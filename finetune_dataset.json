    "input": "Question: What was the cash withdrawal rate at ATMs per capita in India in 2020, and what factors might explain this rate?",
    "output": "In 2020, the cash withdrawals undertaken per person in India was 5, which was the lowest amongst the benchmarked countries, falling from 7 cash withdrawals per person in 2017. While a low ratio might suggest lower cash dependency, in India's case, it may be due to a large population and a relatively low number of ATMs. Additionally, there is a limit on the number of times cash can be withdrawn from ATMs without any charges, which can also act as a deterrent. A higher number of cash withdrawals at ATMs per capita indicates higher dependence on cash. However, cash withdrawals are likely to depend on the ATM density as well, and limited availability of ATMs may impact the number of withdrawals. Further, disruptions caused by the Covid pandemic and restrictions in place on public movement have lowered cash withdrawals in most jurisdictions (except Indonesia). In India, apart from the low ATM density, due to limited availability of ATMs to cater to a huge population there is a restriction on the number of free ATM transactions (financial and non-financial) per month which is likely to have resulted in lower per capita cash withdrawals at ATMs."

    "input": "Question: What factors contribute to India having one of the lowest ratios of cash withdrawal at ATMs to Currency in Circulation (CIC), and what was the value of withdrawal from ATMs compared to the amount of CIC for India in 2020?",
    "output": "India has one of the lowest ratios of cash withdrawal at ATM to CIC. This is likely to be the result of low ATM density coupled with a low number of ATM transactions per capita. The ratio of value of cash withdrawals to CIC declined in most countries (except Turkey) in the year 2020. This is likely to be on account of the restrictions in place due to the CoVID pandemic limiting the number of visits to ATMs and hence impacting the overall value of withdrawals. The value of withdrawal from ATMs was the same as the amount of CIC for India in 2020. This has dropped from 1.6 times CIC in 2017. In 2020, cash withdrawals undertaken per person in India was 5, which was the lowest amongst the benchmarked countries, falling from 7 cash withdrawals per person in 2017."

    "output": "Card payments are one of the primary alternatives to cash, and most jurisdictions have their own domestic card network to promote card transactions. Domestic card networks dominate card usage share in China (99%), France (84%), Germany (37%), and Saudi Arabia (45%). In India, the usage of RuPay cards has significantly grown recently. Jurisdictions with a domestic card network usually promote the usage of domestic cards and establish tie-ups with international card schemes for international transactions. The domestic card network in India received a boost from the Central Government\u2019s efforts to support financial inclusion by promoting the issuance of Rupay debit cards to Basic Savings Bank Deposit (BSBD) account holders. Additionally, MDR has been waived for RuPay debit cards to promote its usage. NPCI is working on building regional partnerships to enhance the international acceptance of RuPay Cards. NPCI's alliance with international network partners like China Union Pay (CUP), Discover Financial Services (DFS), and Japan Credit Bureau (JCB) has paved the way for international acceptance of RuPay. RuPay co-branded international cards using DFS & JCBI BINs are accepted in over 195 countries. Furthermore, NPCI has entered into arrangements with Bhutan and Singapore to accept RuPay cards without co-branding, which is expected to promote more demand for RuPay cards by residents, boosting its market share."

    "output": "India has witnessed a robust growth in credit transfer volumes between 2017 and 2020 compared to other benchmarked countries. The volume stands at a staggering 27.97 billion during the year 2020 which grew at a CAGR of 68% between 2017 and 2020. In India, retail credit transfers are undertaken through NEFT, NACH Credit, IMPS and UPI.\n\nThe growth in credit transfer payments in India can be attributed to the \u2018interoperable payment systems\u2019 which have revolutionised the payments landscape. Interoperability has facilitated use of payments infrastructure by banks and third-party application providers, bringing convenience to the consumers . The credit transfer systems are used for effecting funds transfers to beneficiaries, as an alternative to cash and cards for making payments and also to scan QR codes and undertake merchant payments.\n\nThe share of credit transfers in overall payment systems transactions grew from 37.5% in 2017 to 68.8% in 2020 and is now the highest amongst the benchmarked countries."

    "output": "A high share of credit transfers in total payment transactions indicates consumer preference for credit transfer systems over other forms of payment systems (direct debits, paper clearing) and instruments (Cards, e-Money) for making payments. India has a bouquet of retail credit transfer systems (NEFT, IMPS, UPI, AePS, NACH) with many of the systems (NEFT, IMPS, UPI) available round the clock and facilitating real time payments. This has contributed to India emerging as the leader as far as share of credit transfers in 2020 is concerned. In 2020, the share of credit transfers in overall payment systems transactions in India grew to 68.8%, making it the highest amongst the benchmarked countries. Credit transfers are also observed to dominate the payments in Indonesia, with a 56% share in 2020."

    "input": "Question: What are large value payment systems and what impact do RTGS operating hours have on the economy?",
    "output": "Large value payment systems are systemically important FMIs that are critical elements of a country\u2019s national payment system. RTGS facilitates real time large value fund transfers on a gross settlement basis, which helps reduce credit risk. Gross settlement is liquidity intensive and requires payment, irrespective of its nature, to be pre-funded to ensure settlement. In view of the significance of RTGS, countries have adopted different criteria for granting access to this system. In most jurisdictions RTGS is owned and operated by the central bank and is used for customer and inter-bank payments. To ensure settlement in central bank money, settlement files of ancillary payment systems are posted to RTGS for final settlement. RTGS operating hours have a significant impact on the economy as the system processes large value corporate transactions. Extension of operating hours of RTGS can facilitate an increase in market timings. Further, extended availability of RTGS can ensure posting of additional settlement cycles for ancillary payment systems and reduce the build-up of settlement, credit, and default risks, thus enhancing the efficiency of payments ecosystem. A wide overlap in operations of RTGS systems across jurisdictions can also be leveraged to integrate payment systems and enhance cross-border payment arrangements. In India, the RTGS system, owned and operated by RBI, was introduced in 2004 and has undergone various changes over the years. The RTGS system is running round the clock from December 14, 2020; making India one of the few countries in the world to have its large value payment system operating 24x7. In India, RTGS was made available round the clock from December 14, 2020. This initiative provided increased flexibility for corporates and individuals to undertake payments and ensured posting of additional settlement cycles of ancillary payment systems. In India access to RTGS was earlier permitted to domestically located banks, clearing houses and broker dealers. The membership criteria for RTGS was reviewed in July 2021 and PSOs, viz. prepaid payment instrument Issuers, card networks and white label ATM operators were permitted to participate in RTGS as direct members. Granting access to non-banks helps reduce costs for members, minimise their dependence on banks, reduce time taken for undertaking payments and eliminates uncertainty in finality of payments."

    "output": "India is one of the few countries that has two fast payment systems, namely IMPS and UPI. The adoption of instant payments in India has been remarkable, with India dominating the number of transactions undertaken using fast payment systems as compared to other countries for which data is available. In addition to IMPS and UPI, India also has another retail payment system operated by RBI, which is NEFT. Although NEFT is not a fast payment system because it is settled in half-hourly batches, it runs 24x7 without settlement risk as payment is made to the beneficiary only after the settlement."

    "output": "Examples of countries with fast payment systems include India (IMPS and UPI), Mexico (SPEI), Singapore (Fast), and the United Kingdom (UK Faster Payment). These systems support services like P2P payments, merchant payments, bulk/batch payments, bill payments, and foreign inward remittance. Access channels vary from internet/mobile banking, SMS, USSD, ATM, QR codes, and NFC. Some offer direct access to non-bank payment service providers, and settlement models include deferred net settlement and hybrid models. Fast payments are payments in which the transmission of the payment message and the availability of \u201cfinal\u201d funds to the payee occur in real time or near-real time and the systems run as near to a \u201824-hour and seven-day (24x7)\u2019 basis as possible."

    "input": "Question: What impact have fast payment systems had on payments and what functionalities do they support?",
    "output": "The introduction of fast payment systems has led to various innovations and revolutionized the way payments are undertaken. Across jurisdictions, fast payment systems support multiple functionalities such as bill payments, QR based payments, NFC based payments, request to pay, etc. Fast payment systems are also leveraged to provide non-financial services such as account alias services, balance enquiry, payment scheduling, etc. Various jurisdictions are engaged in establishing linkages between their fast payment systems and payment systems in other jurisdictions to facilitate instant cross-border payments. Jurisdictions have followed different approaches to granting access to non-banks to their fast payment systems with some granting direct access (Mexico, Singapore, United Kingdom) and others permitting indirect access (Australia, Europe, India, Hong Kong). Among the benchmarked countries, only IBPS in China did not permit access to non-banks and only the SPEI system in Mexico followed a hybrid settlement model. The settlement method adopted also varied across systems with some following real time gross settlement and others adopting deferred net settlement. Fast payment systems are driving the overall retail payments in India, at least in terms of volume. Fast payments constituted over 73% of the total retail payment transactions in India in March 2022. UPI alone processed 5.4 billion transactions in March 2022 accounting for 64% of the retail payment transactions. The UPI system powers multiple bank accounts into a single mobile application of any participating bank / non-bank Third Party Application Provider (TPAP). Further, at present, there are 20 TPAPs (Google, WhatsApp, Amazon, etc.) partnering with banks to facilitate UPI transactions."

    "output": "The share of direct debits was observed to have increased, noticeably, from 2017 to 2020 only in France, Korea and Sweden. In India, although the number of direct debit transactions are increasing over the years, the payments landscape is dominated by credit transfer transactions, explaining the considerably low share of direct debit transactions (2.5% in 2020). Direct debit transactions dominate the payments landscape in Germany where the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) direct debit is popular. SEPA direct debit is pull-based, wherein merchants can initiate multiple payments on receipt of a mandate from their customer. Payments take place directly between banks, and no card networks are involved. SEPA direct debit payments are faster and cheaper for businesses as compared to card-based alternatives. However, the share of direct debits witnessed a drop in Germany from 48.4% in 2017 to 44.6% in 2020."

In 2020, with 4958 million e-Money transactions, India was behind only Japan (8641 million), United States of America (7486 million) and Hong Kong (5206 million), out of the benchmarked countries for which data is available. e-Money transactions in India have increased at a CAGR of 13% between 2017 and 2020. Furthermore, in December 2019, a \u201csmall\u201d PPI (Prepaid Payment Instrument) was introduced with minimum KYC requirement and amount loaded in a month capped at \u20b910,000. Further, in May 2021, the limit for amount outstanding in PPIs with full KYC compliance was enhanced to \u20b92,00,000. The introduction of interoperability between PPIs has obviated the need for on-boarding customers separately across various issuers and acquirers and has led to increased access and cost-effectiveness for consumers. Brazil is observed to be the leader in terms of growth, with CAGR of 372%, in volume terms between 2017 and 2020, primarily because of the low transaction volume in 2017 (28 million). The exponential growth of e-Money transactions during the period was majorly led by rising popularity of e-commerce and the population\u2019s familiarity with smartphones."

    "output": "The ACC Working Group on \u201cInflation, external financial conditions and macro-financial stability frameworks in Asia-Pacific\u201d examined how the joint use of monetary, macroprudential, exchange rate and capital flow management policies helped deal with the stressed period of 2022. This report is based on detailed responses to a questionnaire from member central banks.\n\nAsia-Pacific economies faced an unprecedented combination of shocks during 2022: lingering waves of the Covid-19 pandemic, supply-chain disruptions, the war in Ukraine and the attendant rise in global food and energy prices, as well as tightening global financial conditions. While supply-chain disruptions gradually dissipated, inflation remained generally high during 2022. On the financial side, most regional economies saw depreciating currencies, rising bond yields and volatile portfolio flows.\n\nEconomy-specific characteristics, including structural factors, the state of the economy and policy buffers, underpinned how sensitive regional economies were to these shocks. Higher global commodity prices were inflationary nearly everywhere, especially in economies dependent on imports of essentials.\n\nBanks had generally robust balance sheets and tended to rely on domestic funding, with any foreign currency funding either hedged or offset by liquid foreign currency assets, all of which helped to insulate domestic financial systems from external shocks. More generally, the region\u2019s resilience was enhanced by reforms made during recent decades such as increasing banks\u2019 capital and liquidity buffers, ensuring adequate loan loss provisions for banks, growing levels of FX reserves, strengthening monetary policy frameworks, active use of macroprudential measures and capital market liberalisation efforts. Debt, however, was generally higher across regional economies in 2022 than before the pandemic, which narrowed the policy space somewhat.\n\nSupply-side factors played the largest role in triggering a spike in inflation in many regional economies in early to mid-2022, while demand-side factors (eg pent-up demand and expansionary policies) became more important later in 2022 in some economies. That said, labour market flexibility, wage negotiation arrangements and the degree of competition among firms, generally helped keep a lid on second-round effects. Past progress in anchoring inflation expectations also dampened the risk of such effects.\n\nExchange rate fluctuations affected regional economies via three channels. First, inflation was impacted via the pass-through channel. While the sensitivity of inflation to a given change in the exchange rate has been trending down over time for most regional economies, the impact on inflation in 2022 was sizeable in some economies due to the magnitude of the currency depreciations and potential non-linearities coming into play. Second, growth was buoyed via the trade channel due to weakening currencies, especially for net commodity exporters, although this channel was noted to be relatively unimportant in 2022 by some members. Finally, due to high exchange rate volatility, financial channels related to foreign currency debt and foreign holdings of local currency debt posed challenges to regional economies in 2022.

    "output": "Authorities in most ACC economies tended to use one primary tool along with multiple complementary tools for each policy objective during 2022. In the pursuit of price stability, interest rates remained the primary tool, although central banks differed in terms of when and how forcefully they raised rates. Complementary measures, such as withdrawing liquidity in advance of raising rates, FX interventions and government subsidies on key consumer items, were also used to assist rate hikes in reducing the impact of inflation or to ease monetary policy trade-offs. Regarding the objective of domestic financial stability, macroprudential tools continued to play the central role in many economies. Some jurisdictions tightened housing-related macroprudential measures while others loosened them depending on prevailing trends in property markets. Regulatory relief and liquidity provision measures introduced during the early stage of the pandemic complemented the use of macroprudential measures during 2022. Their use, however, tended to wane or become more targeted as economic conditions improved and the need to consolidate policy space gained prominence. As regards external stability, many emerging market economy (EME) central banks in the region used FX interventions as the first line of defence against excessive FX volatility. They acknowledged the role of flexible exchange rates as shock-absorbers and intervened primarily to counter perceived speculative behaviour and excessive FX volatility. That said, some central banks viewed FX interventions as warranted in cases where sharp depreciations posed a risk to their inflation mandates. Some ACC economies also used FX-related macroprudential measures in support of external stability, with their frequency and/or intensity being greater where financial markets were thin or illiquid, FX exposures were poorly hedged, foreign investors played a more prominent role or FX reserves were smaller.\n\nThe policy responses by ACC economies in 2022 (a period of increasing inflation and tightening global financial conditions) differed from those used before the pandemic (a period of low and stable inflation and loose global financial conditions). In general, members\u2019 macro-financial stability frameworks (MFSFs) accommodated authorities adjusting the degree to which multiple policy tools are used jointly over time, depending on the economic environment. Indeed, before the pandemic, many central banks came close to having \u201cone instrument used mainly for one primary objective\u201d, with other instruments being used relatively infrequently. Several central banks (especially those in EMEs) used the primary instrument more forcefully in 2022 than before the pandemic, and also made greater use of complementary tools. That is, in contrast to more normal times, in 2022 they frequently used multiple tools for an at-risk objective.\n\nWorking group members identified several lessons from operating MFSFs in 2022, including: (i) new or previously scarcely used tools may become a regular part of the toolbox in some economies; (ii) experience with how tools interact may assist in optimising their joint use in future; (iii) greater understanding of the trade-offs associated with the pre-emptive versus reactive use of tools and the need for flexibility in switching focus between alternative goals; and (iv) the key role of structural reforms in strengthening the ecosystem in which MFSFs operate and hence improving the efficacy of MFSFs. Members underscored that, overall, the effectiveness of MFSFs hinges on taking account of aspects such as: (i) trade-offs; (ii) interactions or complementarities; (iii) constraints or limits; (iv) communication with stakeholders; and (v) coordination between authorities. Once inflation moves closer to central bank targets and global financial conditions stabilise, ACC central banks may wish to rebalance their policy mix and rebuild policy buffers. A pandemic-induced shift in relevant \u201cstate variables\u201d, such as increased debt levels, implies that any transition will have to be cautious and gradual."

    "input": "Question: What challenges did Asia-Pacific economies face in 2022, and how did they respond according to the ACC working group's assessment?",
    "output": "In 2022, Asia-Pacific economies faced unprecedented challenges: sharp rises in global energy and food prices and tightening global financial conditions amid elevated domestic macro-financial vulnerabilities. To deal with these challenges, central banks and other financial authorities in Asia-Pacific actively used monetary, macroprudential and exchange rate policies to maintain macroeconomic, domestic financial, and external stability. Against this backdrop, in September 2022, the Asian Consultative Council (ACC) Governors agreed to form a working group on \u201cInflation, external financial conditions and macro-financial stability frameworks in Asia-Pacific\u201d. This report lays out the working group\u2019s assessment of how central banks and other financial authorities in the ACC economies operated their macro-financial stability frameworks (MFSFs) between late 2021 and the end of 2022. Based on the responses of working group members to a detailed questionnaire, the report first highlights the various shocks that these economies faced and the economy-specific characteristics that influenced their sensitivity to those shocks. Second, it outlines the drivers of inflation and the relative strength of different exchange rate channels in the member economies. The report then examines the economies\u2019 policy responses along two dimensions. The first dimension is how the use of tools varied across economies. In many ACC economies, authorities used multiple tools for each of their policy objectives in 2022. Members\u2019 questionnaire responses help explain why the policy mixes varied, ie how the nature of the shocks and economy-specific characteristics (including structural factors, the state of the economy and policy buffers) mapped into the diverse policy mixes adopted. In pursuit of price stability, differences in factors such as perceived drivers of inflation (eg supply versus demand), the nature of inflation dynamics, the central bank\u2019s historical experience with tackling inflation, and the strength of the economic recovery from the pandemic explained the diverse use of interest rates as well as supplementary tools. Regarding the objective of domestic financial stability, the deployment of macroprudential measures and other policy tools likewise depended on economy-specific characteristics, such as the share of bank-based finance, pressures in the housing market, debt levels and debt serviceability, as well as on the distributional effects of the shocks within an economy, across both agents and financial institutions. As regards external stability, the size and intensity of FX interventions \u2013 considered by many central banks to be the first line of defence but not necessarily the primary tool for external stability \u2013 depended on the perceived drivers of exchange rate volatility (eg the relative role of fundamentals versus herd behaviour in financial markets) and the availability of FX reserves. While authorities in some member economies also used various FX-related macroprudential measures or other capital flow management measures (CFMs), those with deeper and more liquid financial markets, a higher proportion of hedged FX exposures and/or domestic investors, or larger FX reserves generally used these measures less frequently and/or less intensely. The second dimension is how the use of tools varied over time, ie how the policy response by ACC economies in 2022 (a period of increasing inflation and tightening global financial conditions) differed from the one used in 2019 (a period of low and stable inflation and loose global financial conditions). A common feature of MFSFs across many ACC economies is their ability to adjust the joint use of multiple tools over time. Such variation could stem, for instance, from differences in the nature of the shocks hitting an economy or from changes in both domestic and global macroeconomic and financial circumstances. Indeed, before the pandemic, many central banks came close to having \u201cone instrument used mainly for one primary objective\u201d, with other instruments being used only relatively infrequently, as outlined in the previous working group report (ACC (2020)). In 2022, several central banks (especially those in emerging market economies (EMEs)) used the primary instrument more forcefully than in 2019, and also made greater use of secondary tools.

    "input": "Question: What considerations were highlighted in the report regarding rebalancing policy mix and rebuilding policy buffers, and what key aspects of policy actions were emphasized for the effectiveness of MFSFs?",
    "output": "Looking ahead, the report considers how central banks may want to rebalance their policy mix and rebuild policy buffers (especially for domestic financial and external stability) in the near term. Ideally, policymakers may prefer to roll back extraordinary measures (eg subsidies) once stress subsides and rebalance to a mix that is more comparable to that in place before the pandemic. That said, some members noted that a pandemic-induced shift in some of the relevant \u201cstate variables\u201d (eg elevated debt levels or structural changes in trade patterns) matter for the rebalancing. Thus, any transition in the policy mix \u2013 from the one in 2022 which was meant to address high inflation and tight global financial conditions, to one suited for a period of lower inflation and looser global financial conditions \u2013 will have to be cautious and gradual. Members also noted that the existence of buffers enabled their respective jurisdictions to launch an effective policy response in 2022, underscoring the importance of ensuring that buffers remain sufficient in the future. The report concludes with a discussion of how lessons learnt by the authorities from their policy experiences in 2022 can help further develop their respective MFSFs. Members noted that while many lessons were common across jurisdictions, others depended on economy-specific contexts. Thus, not every lesson applies in every jurisdiction. For instance, an overall positive experience with the use of some new tools (such as bond purchase programmes in some economies) may justify their more permanent inclusion in the policy toolkit. Members also noted the need for flexibility in switching focus between alternative goals (eg from growth to inflation) in response to new data. Some central banks stressed the need to focus on addressing the root cause of instabilities to the extent possible (rather than only managing the symptoms). Several noted the importance of being forward looking, especially when adopting structural policies. And almost all emphasised that communication of the policy mix and its goals with relevant stakeholders is a core element of the policy toolkit. Overall, many members\u2019 responses reflected the view that the effectiveness of MFSFs hinges on taking account of the following key aspects of the policy actions: trade-offs (eg between stabilising inflation and output or between growth and external balance as well as those arising from leakages or unintended consequences), interactions or complementarities (eg one tool could help mitigate the spillovers from another), constraints or limits (such as diminishing returns to the continued use of a tool), policy communication (eg especially when different policies appear to be out of sync), and coordination between authorities (eg between the central bank, any other financial authorities and the government)."

    "output": "In 2022, the policy objectives of ACC economies were affected by multiple domestic and external shocks, as illustrated in Graph 1. These shocks included the war in Ukraine, which led to a surge in global commodity prices (especially fertilisers, energy and cereal crops such as wheat) that was felt in all economies. Geopolitics aggravated inflation globally by perpetrating protectionism and de-globalisation sentiments (as noted by New Zealand), and a deterioration in sentiments impeded economic activity (as noted by China). While all regional economies faced elevated energy prices, none experienced energy shortages.\n\nEnergy prices peaked around the middle of the year. However, global food prices remained elevated, with even self-sufficient economies seeing higher domestic food prices due to increased input costs, including fertilisers. Export restrictions, prompted by food security concerns, softened domestic inflation somewhat but exacerbated food inflation for import-dependent countries.\n\nThe services sector, already struggling due to the pandemic, continued to lag in 2022 because of ongoing restrictions on human movement and the accumulation of capital losses, which reduced their ability to scale output. This sluggish recovery affected tourism and some economies severely (e.g., Hong Kong SAR and Thailand), with high-contact activities remaining affected (as noted by Indonesia).\n\nSome economies experienced large fluctuations in housing markets, with house prices surging and then correcting over the course of 2022 (e.g., Australia, Korea, and New Zealand). Drivers included low mortgage rates due to expansionary monetary policy in 2020\u201321, a change in."

    "output": "Major shocks to the ACC economies included an increase in policy rates in some major advanced economies (AEs) outside the region, which tightened global financial conditions. The speed of AE rate hikes was faster than anticipated, coinciding with a global transition in investor behavior from risk-on to risk-off, partly due to the war in Ukraine. These shocks led to a sharp depreciation in regional economies\u2019 currencies against major AE currencies, especially the US dollar, and portfolio capital outflows for most of 2022. While domestic financial markets in regional economies remained generally resilient, external shocks contributed to dislocations in asset markets in the form of surges in bond yields or episodes of bond and equity market volatility (e.g., Japan). Domestic factors also played a role in some cases (e.g., Korea)."

    "output": "Various structural factors are especially relevant to inflation, including the degree to which cost shocks pass through to inflation, labor market characteristics, and the degree to which inflation expectations are anchored. Financial market depth helps determine an economy's resilience to external demand for domestic debt. Economies with deep and liquid FX spot and derivatives markets, like Australia, have less need to respond when external shocks hit. The nature of external financial flows also matters; Thailand and Vietnam noted that the capital flows they face are primarily longer-term in nature, making the domestic economy less vulnerable to fluctuations in global financial conditions. The dominant mode of financing also plays a role. The financial systems in most ACC economies are bank-based rather than market-based, and banks are mostly domestically funded, which can provide some insulation against external financial conditions."

    "output": "Factors related to the state of the economy can make it more or less vulnerable to shocks, including the level and composition of debt, housing prices, the role of foreign investors in local markets, and banks\u2019 exposure to liquidity and solvency risks. In 2022, debt was generally higher across regional economies than before the pandemic, driven by support measures, low interest rates, and declining nominal GDP. Mortgages comprised a large share of household debt in some economies (e.g., Australia, Korea, New Zealand, and Singapore), while property prices varied. The share of floating-rate debt also differed across economies, with Malaysia having a majority of floating-rate loans and the Philippines having mostly fixed-rate corporate loans. Most regional economies had a small share of debt issued in foreign currencies, which helped reduce financial stability risks."

    "input": "Question: What were the general conditions of bank balance sheets and policy buffers in regional EMEs coming into 2022, and what factors contributed to inflation spikes in early to mid-2022?",
    "output": "Coming into 2022, bank balance sheets were generally sound and banks\u2019 exposures to liquidity and solvency risks in the region were limited. With a few exceptions, bank balance sheet measures, such as the size of capital and liquidity buffers, showed robustness (in large part due to the reforms adopted after the Great Financial Crisis (GFC) of 2007\u201308). Stress tests in some economies, such as India and the Philippines, also indicated bank resilience. In addition, banks\u2019 disclosures indicated low levels of non-performing loans (NPLs) in early- to mid-2022, although these were starting to rise in many cases (and may rise further in 2023 and 2024 due to interest rate increases and rising debt servicing costs).\n\nPolicy buffers reflect stocks available to policymakers that can be run down, if necessary, in response to negative shocks. One is the level of FX reserves, which can not only help deter currency attacks in the first place, but also serves as a buffer in the event of destabilising exchange rate dynamics. Additional FX buffers include access to foreign currency liquidity in a crisis via arrangements that make up the global financial safety net (including bilateral swap arrangements, regional financial arrangements and multilateral arrangements). Capital flow-related macroprudential measures \u2013 which can be lowered or removed as necessary \u2013 had also helped build buffers in some EMEs in the region. Another set of policy buffers have to do with the banking system \u2013 the so-called regulatory buffers. These include countercyclical or conservation capital buffers, liquidity buffers (such as those supported by liquidity coverage ratios (LCRs)), systemic risk buffers for globally and domestic systemically important banks (G-SIBs and D-SIBs), and housing-specific macroprudential buffers (e.g., prudent loan-to-value (LTV) ratio limits, which have a long history of use in many EMEs in the region, and debt service ratio (DSR) limits).\n\nRegarding inflation, working group members\u2019 responses to the questionnaire indicate that supply-side factors \u2013 especially cost-push pressures \u2013 played the largest role in triggering a spike in inflation in many regional economies in early to mid-2022. This reflected sharp rises in global food and energy prices and, in some cases, restrictions due to the pandemic. Government support measures, such as targeted subsidies or reductions in tariffs and duties, helped to reduce the pass-through to measured inflation in several economies including India, Indonesia, Korea, the Philippines, Thailand."

    "input": "Question: What factors played a role in inflation, wage-price spirals, and inflation expectations in various economies during 2022?",
    "output": "In 2022, supply-side factors, especially cost-push pressures from sharp rises in global food and energy prices, played a significant role in triggering inflation in many regional economies, with China and Hong Kong SAR being outliers due to comparatively low food and energy items in their CPI. Government support measures like subsidies and tax reductions helped reduce the pass-through to measured inflation in several economies, including India, Indonesia, Korea, the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam. Broad-based measures may have contributed to demand and hence inflation.\n\nDemand-side factors, such as pent-up demand and higher savings buffers, became more important over time, keeping inflation high even as supply-side factors subsided. The rotation of demand to services with stickier prices also contributed to persistent inflation.\n\nThe level of competition affected firms' ability to raise prices, with Malaysia, the Philippines, and Vietnam noting that higher global prices combined with resurgent demand enabled businesses to pass on higher costs.\n\nAs inflation persisted, risks of second-round effects and de-anchoring of inflation expectations grew, but economy-specific factors helped keep these risks in check. Labour market characteristics lowered the risk of wage-price spirals in economies where firms prioritized market share or had flexible labor markets. In Vietnam, business owners' bargaining power reduced wage pressures. Increased labor supply in Australia and the Philippines, and factors like continued slack in the labor market in Malaysia, also limited wage increases.\n\nHowever, tight labor markets in some economies, like Singapore, added to the risk of wage-price spirals, and signs of changes in price and wage-setting behaviors were noted in Japan. Nonetheless, sustained wage-price spirals did not take hold in most economies.\n\nLong-term inflation expectations remained anchored in most jurisdictions due to structural reforms, such as strengthened inflation targeting regimes. In India, despite higher fuel prices, inflation expectations of professional forecasters remained within the target range. Similarly, in Australia, expectations generally increased, but medium- and long-term expectations remained within the inflation target range. In Singapore, while 5-year inflation expectations rose to a peak of 4.8% in March 2022, they eased to 4.2% in December 2022."

    "input": "Question: How did exchange rate depreciation affect regional economies in 2022, and what were the primary channels through which these effects were transmitted?",
    "output": "In 2022, most regional economies faced depreciations in their exchange rates. These depreciations influenced inflation, economic activity, and financial stability via three main channels: the pass-through channel, the trade channel, and the financial channel. The inflation pass-through channel refers to how exchange rate changes affect domestic prices. The trade channel reflects the impact of exchange rates on exports and imports. The financial channel involves the impact on financial variables such as domestic credit and long-term interest rates. In regional economies, the pass-through channel is either structurally weak or has been weakening over time. However, during 2022, because the size of the depreciation was substantial in many cases, the inflationary impact was often large. Regarding the trade channel, growth rates in some economies were initially buoyed as weakening currencies offered a competitive advantage, a process that partially reversed in the final months of 2022 when the US dollar depreciated. On top of this, net commodity exporters tended to see a current account boost on account of rising commodity prices in US dollars, reinforced by a stronger US dollar, while importers experienced the opposite effect."

    "input": "Question: How did exchange rate depreciation affect regional economies in terms of inflation, economic activity, and financial stability?",
    "output": "Exchange rate depreciation affected regional economies through three main avenues: the pass-through, trade, and financial channels. While some jurisdictions, including Korea, reported that the trade channel was less important due to weak global trade growth, others, like Japan, saw limited export trade gains due to supply constraints. Some members noted that the US dollar exchange rate mattered more than the trade-weighted exchange rate due to the dominant currency pricing and invoicing paradigm. Despite some volatility, the financial channels were perceived to be relatively manageable due to factors like weakening \"original sin\" and robust domestic bond markets. Economies with net foreign currency asset positions, like Australia and Korea, saw increased valuation of these assets due to domestic currency depreciations, strengthening balance sheets. Policy buffers, such as sufficient FX reserves, also provided a degree of insurance, especially in EMEs in the region. In economies with relatively deep and developed financial markets, like Australia and New Zealand, close integration between domestic and global capital markets meant that increases in term premia in the United States or shocks to global risk aversion led to higher domestic rates and rising risk premiums. Furthermore, relatively low dependence on external financing (ie foreign currency debt or foreign investor holdings), is clearly a factor, and notably so for some jurisdictions (eg China and India), additional factors also play a role in cushioning potentially destabilising outflows. These include well-functioning and deep domestic markets and high credit ratings (as noted by Australia), robust policy frameworks, strong regulatory and institutional arrangements, the availability of hedging instruments to foreign investors (as noted by Malaysia), the presence or deepening of the domestic institutional investor base as a stabiliser (as noted by Indonesia and the Philippines) and, more generally, the role that foreign investors play in diversifying funding sources (as noted by Singapore)."

Intervention in domestic bond and money markets, FX interventions, and domestic liquidity provision were also used to maintain macroeconomic stability, albeit less frequently or intensely.

    "input": "Question: How did central banks differ in their approach to hiking rates and what factors influenced their policy choices in 2022?",
    "output": "Central banks differed in whether they hiked rates gradually or front-loaded their responses. Those with a higher proportion of floating-rate debt in the economy (especially among households) or with more debt in general stressed that these factors were considered when determining the speed with which they hiked policy rates (e.g., Korea). A few central banks also took into account financial stability risks that stemmed from the impact higher interest rates would have on households that took on large mortgages during recent housing booms (e.g., New Zealand). Relatedly, those who perceived inflation to be primarily driven by supply-side factors (e.g., Thailand) tended to adopt the gradual route. By contrast, the RBI frontloaded rate actions by increasing the policy repo rate by 190 basis points in the first five months of the hiking cycle (out of a total increase of 250 basis points between May 2022 and February 2023). Those that placed more weight on potential frictions in monetary policy transmission (including the fact that it can take a few quarters for a monetary policy action to have its maximum effects) or observed clear signs of second-round effects (for example, as reflected by an increase in petitions for minimum wage increases and hikes in transportation fees in the Philippines) acted more aggressively. Some central banks in this camp acknowledged that such an approach was justified even though it may have hurt growth and raised financial stability risks. This is because central bank credibility in terms of combating inflation may be undermined, and any policy response can become less effective if inflation rises sharply later. Further, members noted that complementary policy tools were used to address some of these challenges. An overarching theme across economies was that a mix of policy measures, including from authorities other than central banks, was used to support rate hikes in the pursuit of price stability in 2022. In the Philippines, for instance, a temporary reduction in import tariff rates, time-bound increases in permitted import volumes and diversification of import sources were used to fill short-term supply gaps in food commodities and relieve price pressures. In economies with an asset (e.g., bond) purchase programme in operation during 2021, policymakers reduced the rate of purchase in 2022 in order to support policy rate increases in taming inflation (e.g., Australia and the Philippines). In some other economies, tools such as reserve requirements were tightened to withdraw liquidity ahead of policy rate increases. Some central banks waited to see more convincing evidence of inflation\u2019s rise becoming self-sustaining, while others acted as soon as the risk of second-round effects and rising core inflation became apparent to them. Characteristics such as the nature of inflation dynamics in the jurisdiction, the central bank\u2019s historical experience with tackling inflation, and the level of inflation prior to 2022 played a role in underpinning central banks\u2019 policy choices in this regard. The expected growth trajectory and the use of other policies to cushion supply-side shocks also mattered for monetary policy decisions."

    "input": "Question: What policy measures, besides rate hikes, were used to support price stability in 2022?",
    "output": "In 2022, a mix of policy measures, including those from authorities other than central banks, was used to support rate hikes in the pursuit of price stability. For instance, the Philippines temporarily reduced import tariff rates, increased permitted import volumes, and diversified import sources to fill short-term supply gaps in food commodities and relieve price pressures. Economies with asset purchase programs in operation during 2021, like Australia and the Philippines, reduced the rate of purchase in 2022 to support policy rate increases. Some economies, such as India and Indonesia, tightened reserve requirements to withdraw liquidity ahead of policy rate rises. While a flexible exchange rate was generally seen as a shock absorber for external price shocks, some authorities used FX interventions to minimize the risk of excessive exchange rate movements and dampen the pass-through to inflation, as seen in the Philippines and Vietnam. Exchange rate intervention also helped anchor expectations and facilitated the overarching objective of maintaining macroeconomic stability and market confidence, particularly in economies with greater dependence on imports of essentials like food and energy. Central banks also employed communication policies, with regular communication helping keep inflation expectations anchored in economies like India and Malaysia, and targeted communications explaining the rationale and objectives of policy actions in economies like Indonesia and Thailand. Fiscal measures like electricity or fuel subsidies in the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam, or rental waivers and consumption vouchers in Hong Kong SAR, helped ease the short-term burden of inflation on households. Various tools were used to manage the impact of higher policy rates on borrowers, banks, and the flow of bank credit, including lowering the cash reserve ratio or countercyclical capital buffers, maintaining previously introduced loan restructuring measures, preserving a previously relaxed LTV ratio, providing additional incentives to lend to specific sectors, increasing limits for external funding, and encouraging banks to continue to assist customers with financial difficulties by rescheduling or restructuring loans. In some cases, the expiry date of previously announced measures was delayed with similar objectives in mind, and to support growth more generally."

    "output": "Several regional authorities also adopted measures to support borrowers. For example, in Korea, a fiscally funded package was issued to convert floating-rate loans \u2013 which constituted a high proportion of household loans \u2013 to fixed-rate loans and thus mitigate the impact of rate hikes on borrowers (and therefore, ultimately, on the health of banks). In Hong Kong SAR, existing principal payment holidays and loan guarantee programmes were extended a few times. In Thailand, asset classifications and provisioning guidelines were relaxed to encourage financial institutions to restructure borrowers\u2019 debt, while credit card minimum monthly payments were reduced to help vulnerable segments of the population during the transition period. In India, measures aimed at individuals and small businesses included a temporary period of loan moratorium on payment of installments, easing of working capital financing, and allowing lenders to restructure borrower accounts under a special resolution framework. Other regional authorities adopted measures to ensure that the banking sector maintained adequate room for manoeuvre, thus enabling the banking sector to better support economic growth. Vietnam used open market operations to support the short-term liquidity needs of credit institutions. In addition to open market operations, India also put in place a scheme committing upfront to a specific amount of open market purchases of government securities with a view to ensuring a stable and orderly evolution of the yield curve. China worked to reduce banks\u2019 exposure to the real estate sector, which was deemed to have been subject to over-investment. And a few central banks used programmes like funding for lending (FFL) to incentivise the flow of credit generally or to specific sectors (eg India)."

    "input": "Question: How did regional economies respond to exchange rate and capital flow stresses in 2022, and what tools did they employ to manage external stability?",
    "output": "In 2022, regional economies faced stresses on exchange rates and capital flows, impacting domestic financial and macroeconomic stability. Most EME central banks used FX interventions to address excessive exchange rate volatility, aiming for a gradual and orderly equilibrium without resisting fundamental changes. These interventions were crucial in economies where exchange rate movements threatened inflation and public confidence, such as Indonesia, the Philippines, and Vietnam. Japan also used FX intervention for the first time since 2011 due to sharp yen movements against the US dollar.\n\nThe size and intensity of interventions depended on the perceived effectiveness and FX reserve levels. Interventions were more focused on volatility caused by speculative behavior or market dysfunction rather than fundamental drivers. Some economies with floating exchange rates, like Australia and Korea, allowed currency depreciation to insulate themselves from external shocks. China aimed to improve its managed floating exchange rate system to minimize FX intervention.\n\nFX interventions were part of a broader toolkit that included capital flow management measures (CFMs), particularly FX-related macroprudential measures to reduce systemic risks. Measures included adjusting limits on external commercial borrowing, relaxing restrictions on foreign investment, and managing currency lending to non-residents. Some measures also aimed to attract inflows by relaxing portfolio investment rules and granting tax exemptions on bond investments. India liberalized capital flows while ensuring macroeconomic and financial stability."

    "input": "Question: What tools beyond FX interventions were used to maintain external stability in regional economies, and what factors influenced the authorities' responses?",
    "output": "Policy rate hikes were also (directly or indirectly) a part of the external stability toolkit. For some economies like Indonesia, the Philippines, and Vietnam, there was a direct link between policy rates and the need to realign interest rates vis-\u00e1-vis those in AEs in Europe or North America (i.e., by limiting changes in interest rate differentials), and thus to respond to tightening global financial conditions and monetary policy spillovers. Thailand noted that FX interventions can help take the pressure off monetary policy in dealing with the impact of external financial conditions on the domestic economy. In some other economies, the link was indirect, as noted above in the case of Korea. In Malaysia, while policy rate changes were not carried out with the objective of strengthening the local currency, rate hikes helped mitigate capital outflows and temper the impact on the ringgit. In Japan, monetary policy is assigned to price stability while exchange rate stability is outside the remit of the central bank.\n\nAdditional tools were also used to deal with external stability. One was FX liquidity provision; for example, China lowered the reserve requirement ratio for FX deposits to release FX liquidity, while foreign currency deposits were temporarily exempted from reserve requirements in India. Another tool was domestic market intervention, which was used in a few economies (e.g., operation twist in Indonesia to affect the yield curve/term premium and thus attract capital inflows). Some central banks also used intensive communication with investors, rating agencies, and other domestic and international stakeholders more generally to build optimism and support exchange rate stabilization policy (e.g., Indonesia). Relatedly, some used forward guidance to manage expectations (e.g., India), while some others used moral suasion to keep speculative trades in check (e.g., the Philippines).\n\nA number of economy-specific characteristics had a bearing on the response that the authorities adopted. Several members noted that the development of deeper and more liquid FX markets in the past facilitated efficient price discovery during 2022 and reduced the need for FX interventions or CFMs (including China, Indonesia, and Malaysia). In addition, minimum hedging requirements on corporates\u2019 net liability exposure in the past helped build firms\u2019 resilience and also mitigated the need for (or intensity of) an ex-post policy response in 2022. In a similar vein, improved FX reserve adequacy helped maintain investor confidence and improved policymakers\u2019 room for maneuver (e.g., in India)."

The table shows that, on average, the primary instrument for each objective remained the same in 2019 and 2022 \u2013 i.e., emerging Asian central banks primarily used policy rates for macroeconomic stability, domestically oriented macroprudential measures for domestic financial stability, and FX intervention for external stability, in both years. Regarding the use of supplementary tools, shades of blue predominate in the left-hand panel for 2019, indicating relatively low use of supplementary tools, especially in pursuit of macroeconomic and domestic financial stability goals. In contrast, the right-hand panel shows a different picture."

    "input": "Question: How did the use of supplementary policy tools change in 2022 compared to previous periods, and what examples illustrate this?",
    "output": "In 2022, light pink shades prevail in many cells, supporting the notion that supplementary tools came to be more commonly used. There are several examples of the more forceful use of the primary tool in pursuit of an at-risk objective in 2022 than in previous periods of low inflation and loose global financial conditions. For instance, in Australia, where the policy interest rate is the primary tool for maintaining price stability, the size and persistence of inflationary shocks during 2022 warranted a series of policy rate rises from May 2022. Singapore provides a similar example: the MAS re-centred the exchange rate policy band upwards three times within a six-month period during 2022, a much more frequent use of this primary policy tool than before. Other economies \u2013 including some EMEs \u2013 provide examples of greater use of supplementary tools in pursuit of policy mandates in 2022 (as highlighted in Section 4) than in the years up to 2019. For example, the BOK used lending facilities and market stabilisation measures to supplement interest rate policy in 2022. In the Philippines, the interest rate remained the first line of defense when dealing with threats to the inflation outlook in 2022, but persistent external shocks that threatened to spill over to inflation saw the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas turn to other tools in fighting inflation, such as FX intervention. Similarly, the Bank of Thailand reported using supplementary measures alongside monetary policy normalisation, but working in the opposite direction of rate rises, in order to help vulnerable groups that were hard hit by policy rate changes. By contrast, none of these three economies mentioned using tools other than policy rates to support macroeconomic stability in the previous report focused on pre-pandemic policies. Sometimes the deployment of additional tools took advantage of policy buffers built up over time. For example, in response to higher inflation amid greater external pressure, BI and the RBI raised reserve requirement ratios and the policy rate, but also used previously built buffers (ie loosened macroprudential policy). By contrast, the previous report indicated that, in general, only policy rates were used for macroeconomic stability goals, and macroprudential measures were only used for domestic financial stability, suggesting limited relevance for policy buffers in the assignment of supplementary tools."

    "instruction": "Answer the question based on the provided context from the financial report.",
    "input": "Question: What are the key dimensions and lessons learned regarding MFSFs that central banks should consider going forward?",
    "output": "Going forward, once inflation moves closer to central bank targets and global financial conditions stabilise, there are three dimensions that central banks may wish to take into account while plotting the way forward.\n\nOne is rebalancing the policy mix, ideally shifting to a mix comparable to pre-pandemic conditions, with monetary policy focusing on macroeconomic stability, macroprudential measures defending against financial imbalances, and a mix of tools for external stability. This process faces challenges like high debt levels and weak real estate markets.\n\nAnother dimension is the need to rebuild policy buffers, as their existence enabled effective policy responses in 2022. Rebuilding macroprudential buffers is important in economies with high household debt, and restoring FX reserves is relevant in jurisdictions that used interventions during currency depreciation in 2022.\n\nLast is taking lessons learnt while operating MFSFs during the recent volatile period to further develop MFSFs for the future. New tools may become regular, and the experience in 2022 offers lessons on how tools interact. Trade-offs associated with the pre-emptive versus reactive use of tools were noted. The nature, intensity, and transmission of shocks matter for the optimal policy response, and addressing root causes of instabilities is more effective. A preference for price-based policies and operational readiness were also noted. The efficacy of MFSFs depends on the ecosystem, underscoring the roles of domestic structural reforms and non-central bank policies.\n\nOverall, the effectiveness of MFSFs hinges on trade-offs, interactions/complementarities, constraints/limits, policy communication, and coordination between authorities. With regards to ensuring macroeconomic stability, several members underscored the importance of flexibility in terms of switching focus between alternative goals."

    "input": "Question: What were the key considerations and lessons learned by central banks regarding monetary policy, domestic financial stability, external stability, and communications?",
    "output": "In response to new data, central banks aimed to maintain price stability as the primary objective, although the room for monetary policy to support growth narrowed in 2022 as the emphasis shifted to ensuring external stability and controlling inflation. Members emphasized a medium-term orientation for monetary policy due to its limited ability to address the root cause of cost-push inflation (though it can address second-round effects), its lagged transmission, and its relationship with financial stability. A more symmetric view of monetary policy formulation was also noted to avoid issues like low-for-long scenarios. Diversification of trading partners and investments in domestic production were seen as medium-run strategies to mitigate risks to price stability and economic growth.\n\nFor maintaining domestic financial stability, Thailand emphasized measures to curb excessive new debt, avoid over-indebtedness, and mitigate debt persistence throughout the debt lifecycle.\n\nRegarding external stability, some members noted that aligning currency value with fundamentals is a way to manage capital flows. However, excessive FX market stabilization may reduce incentives for hedging markets. Certain CFMs may deter foreign investment due to negative signals and hindered financial market development, with implementation challenges arising from arbitrage and circumvention opportunities potentially amplified by financial technology advances.\n\nAcross all objectives, effective communications were deemed key, characterized by being regular, engaging with relevant parties, clear, and utilizing various channels. It's important to convey policy actions, their intent, how they work, and the way forward, including expiration."

    "output": "According to the BIS questionnaire, the various characteristics of an economy that determine how vulnerable it is to macro-financial shocks are:\n1.  Commodity trade dependence: How dependent is your economy on trade in food and energy? (Eg how dependent is it on imports of essentials? Are commodity exports a core driver of economic growth? Data on the ratio of total exports to GDP and the ratio of total imports to GDP broken down by eg (i) food, (ii) energy, (iii) other commodities (like metals) are welcome; impressions of how (much) they matter for your economy are even more welcome.)\n2.  Financial market depth: Are FX spot and derivatives markets for your currency large enough to weather strong volatility in capital flows and exchange rates? To what extent is external debt hedged (approximately)? Does this vary depending on the financial cycle? (Eg are FX hedging costs reasonable during periods of market stress, so that they do not create disincentives for investor inflows?)\n3.  Bank- versus market-based financing: What is the share of bank-based versus market-based finance in your economy? Do banks primarily rely on domestic deposits and funding, or do they source substantial amounts of funding from abroad?\n4.  Debt level and composition: Household, corporate and government sector debt levels swelled in the years leading up to the pandemic in most regional economies. Were the respective credit growth rates consistent with the evolution of the broader economy? (Eg as measured by the credit-to-GDP gap or persistence in credit growth?) What factors contributed to the respective credit growth rates? (Eg low interest rates, fiscal support packages in the case of government debt?) Do you assess current levels of debt to be worrying? (Eg how high is the risk of a surge in non-performing loans/distressed debt? How sensitive are debt servicing costs to short-term interest rates?) In terms of composition, how dependent is your economy on foreign currency-denominated debt? How important are foreign investors in domestic currency (government and corporate) bond and equity markets? (Eg how deep is the domestic investor base? If foreign investors sold local currency assets in 2022, to what extent have purchases by domestic institutional investors helped to stabilise markets?)\n5.  Real estate prices: Did residential and/or commercial real estate prices in your economy increase rapidly in real terms in the several years leading up to late 2021? Were there signs of over-heating (eg historically high prices), of an imminent drop/crash in house prices and/or of fragility (eg rising delinquencies or defaults of housing or development loans) as of late 2021?\n6.  Inflation anchoring: Were inflation expectations believed to be well-anchored in your economy in the period leading up to the pandemic? Is there a sense that this has changed materially since then? (Eg have long-horizon inflation expectations started to rise?) How strong was the pass-through of exchange rate fluctuations and food/energy prices to inflation in your economy over the past decade?\n7.  FX reserves: How do you assess your jurisdiction\u2019s FX reserves adequacy, both prior to and during the pandemic? Did your FX reserve position at end-2021 help pre-empt the impact of tighter global conditions in 2022? (Eg did it improve the confidence of foreign investors and thus reduce incentives to withdraw funding?)\n8.  Macroprudential buffers: Did your jurisdiction use macroprudential measures before the pandemic in response to credit and real estate booms? How effective were they? (Eg did their use help to build solvency or liquidity buffers on the balance sheet of financial intermediaries? Did they affect asset prices?) Did your jurisdiction also use capital flow management measures (CFMs) or FX-related macroprudential measures (ie monetary, prudential and fiscal policy tools calibrated to FX exposures or FX liabilities of banks or non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs))? If so, why? (Eg was it because macroprudential measures were insufficient to deal with externally driven booms in credit or asset prices?)\n9.  Other: What other economy-specific characteristics (if any) play a role in the choice of policy tools in your economy in response to the current combination of shocks?"

CIC may be a sub-optimal indicator to assess extent of payments, as currency, particularly high denomination notes, are also used as a store of value, especially in times of uncertainty like natural disasters and emergencies like the CoVID pandemic.\n*   India is one of the few countries where the large value RTGS system is available round the clock.\n*   The payment systems / instruments across all segments (except paper clearing, where the endeavour is to bring down cheques) have demonstrated robust growth in India. In terms of share of transactions, Unified Payments Interface (UPI) is the dominant system, contributing 68% of payment systems transactions with over 5.4 billion transactions in March 2022.\n*   India has two fast payment systems, viz. Immediate Payment Service (IMPS) and UPI, facilitating instant funds transfers. Further, the National Electronic Funds Transfer (NEFT) system operated by RBI is available 24x7 and ensures settlement in half hourly batches.\n*   The CoVID pandemic related lockdowns and restrictions on public movement in 2020 had an impact on usage of payment instruments at retail outlets. This may be one of the reasons for the lower growth observed in card payments in India as compared to other payment categories in 2020. Overall, after an initial drop, digital transactions picked up during the period as the focus was on \u201cno / less\u201d physical contact.\n*   Notwithstanding the significant expansion in the payment acceptance infrastructure in India during the period, the people per PoS terminals remained high at around 300 people. The operationalisation of the Payments Infrastructure Development Fund (PIDF) in January 2021 has enhanced deployment of payment acceptance infrastructure. Further, India has over 150 million digital PoS terminals (QR codes) that facilitate acceptance of digital payments through cards, e-Money and UPI.\n*   RBI published the updated oversight framework for Financial Market Infrastructures (FMIs) and Retail Payment Systems (RPSs) incorporating the supervisory framework for payment system entities. It further details the oversight objectives and supervisory."

    "output": "In terms of debit and credit card payments vs CIC, the value of card payments to CIC for India, at 0.4, was the lowest amongst the benchmarked countries, indicating a lower preference for using debit and credit cards. As at the end of 2020, India was next to only China and Russia in terms of the number of ATMs deployed; however, over the period from 2017 to 2020, the ATMs deployed in India increased at a CAGR of 2% as compared to 17% in Russia. India has the third largest number of ATMs deployed in absolute terms amongst the benchmarked countries, but it fares poorly when measuring the reach of ATMs, with a single ATM catering to over 5800 people as at end 2020. The cash withdrawals undertaken per person in India in 2020 was 5, which was the lowest amongst the benchmarked countries, falling from 7 cash withdrawals per person in 2017; this may be due to a large population having low accessibility due to a lesser number of ATMs, and limits on the number of free cash withdrawals. India has one of the lowest ratios of cash withdrawal at ATM to CIC, likely the result of low availability of ATMs."

The adoption of instant payments in India has been remarkable, with India dominating the number of transactions undertaken using fast payment systems as compared to other countries for which data is available. In addition, India also has another retail payment system operated by RBI, viz. NEFT, which though not a fast payment system (as it is settled in half-hourly batches), runs 24x7, without settlement risk as payment is made to the beneficiary only after the settlement. Direct debits in India, at a CAGR of 38.6% between 2017 and 2020, have registered the fastest growth amongst the benchmarked countries. However, in terms of volume, the direct debits in India are lower than countries like United States of America, Germany, Brazil, United Kingdom, France and South Korea.

    "output": "According to the Reserve Bank of India\u2019s Benchmarking India\u2019s Payment Systems report, here are the definitions of several terms:\n\nSr No Term Definition \n1 Alternate payments Alternate payments are payments using methods other than cash or physical cards linked to card brand networks. \n2 ATMs Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) are terminals that allow authorised users, typically by using a card, to access a range of services such as cash withdrawals, balance enquiries, transfer of funds and/or acceptance of deposits. \n3 BigTech BigTech is a term that refers to the most dominant and largest technology companies in their respective sectors. Their products and services are used globally and have become heavily relied upon by businesses and individuals alike. \n4 BNPL Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) is a type of short-term financing that allows consumers to make purchases and pay for them at a future date, often interest-free. \n5 CAGR Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) is the average rate at which value of an indicator moves from one value to another over a period of time. \n6 Cards Cards are payment instruments based on a unique number that can be used to initiate a payment, cash withdrawal or cash deposit that is processed using / over a card scheme or \u2013 for withdrawals and deposits at the ATM \u2013 within the network operated by the issuer of the card. For this exercise , cards mean debit and credit cards, unless otherwise stated. \n7 CIC Currency in Circulation (CIC) is the amount of cash within a country that is physically used to conduct transactions between consumers and businesses rather than stored in a bank, financial institution or central bank. This includes notes in circulation and coins in circulation. \n8 Cheques Cheques are payment instruments b ased on written orders from one party (the drawer) to another (the drawee, normally an account holder of a bank) requiring the drawee to pay a specified sum on demand to the drawer or to a third party specified by the drawer. \n9 Credit transfers Credit transfers are based on payment orders or possibl y sequences of payment orders made for the purpose of placing funds at the disposal of the payee. The funds move from the payer\u2019s institution to the payee\u2019s institution, possibly via several other institutions as intermediaries and / or one or more payment systems. In India, this consists of RTGS, NEFT, Electronic Clearing Service ( ECS) Credit, National Automated Clearing House (NACH) Credit, IMPS and UPI."

    "input": "Question: What is the legal framework for payment systems in India, and what role does the Reserve Bank of India play in their regulation?",
    "output": "The legal basis for regulation of payment systems in India emanates from Section 3 of the PSS Act, legislated in 2007, which states that RBI shall be the designated authority for the regulation and supervision of payment systems under this Act. In RBI, a sub-committee of its Central Board is responsible for the general superintendence of the regulation, reflecting the importance accorded to the task. The Reserve Bank\u2019s scope of regulation extends to the whole gamut of payment systems and instruments as also services provided by banks and non-banks. India is one of the few countries that has a designated law on payment systems. In order to maintain public confidence in the payment systems, entry and exit of operators is regulated in India, unlike certain other jurisdictions. Proactive regulation with safety and customer centric initiatives have been the hallmark of developments in retail payment systems. The activities undertaken by payment aggregators have also been included under the regulatory purview with existing payment aggregators being required to apply for authorisation by September 2021. Payment gateways that provide technology infrastructure and facilitate processing of online payment transactions without handling funds have been issued recommendations for baseline technology and do not require authorisation from the regulator. To reduce licensing uncertainties and facilitate long term strategic planning by PSOs, RBI is authorising entities on a perpetual basis, subject to certain conditions. Further, to inculcate discipline and encourage submission of applications by serious players only, the concept of cooling period was introduced where an entity cannot apply for authorisation within one year from the date of revocation / non-renewal / acceptance of voluntary surrender / rejection of application."

Reduction in transaction cost for participants in the ecosystem would serve as a catalyst to onboard additional merchants on to the digital payments\u2019 platform. Regulation of the costs of payment systems requires a fine balance. High costs will discourage consumers / merchants from shifting to digital payments, while low costs may not be remunerative and would discourage investments. RBI\u2019s endeavour is to make the payments space a large-volume, low-average-value and low-cost game for sustained presence and continuance. RBI has waived processing charges on RTGS and NEFT, and directed banks not to levy charges on online NEFT transfers for savings account holders from January 1, 2020.

    "output": "CIC per capita provides an indication of the use of cash, and hence low levels of CIC per capita imply migration to digital payment modes. However, CIC per capita could also reflect income levels per capita in a country, which is demonstrated by the significant variation in levels of CIC per capita in advanced economies as compared to emerging market economies. CIC per capita is observed to have increased in most of the countries (except Brazil, South Africa, Sweden, and Turkey) in 2020 when compared to 2017. The increase in CIC per capita in 2020 could be attributed to the holding of cash by individuals due to the uncertainties being experienced during the challenging times of the CoVID pandemic. High level of CIC does not necessarily indicate the usage of cash for payment transactions, and it can represent the use of currency as a store of value. This is demonstrated by the robust demand observed for higher value denomination of currency across jurisdictions."

This made it the third highest among the countries included in the benchmarking exercise. Only China and Turkey witnessed a decline in CIC as a percentage of GDP in 2020 compared to 2017. Several macro-economic factors influence the demand for currency, including economic growth, interest rate levels, and the demographic profile of the country. The ratio of CIC as a percentage of GDP indicates the dependence on cash in an economy, which serves both as a means of payment and a store of value. The usage of currency as a store of value gained significance during the CoVID pandemic. The onset of the CoVID pandemic led to a dash for cash across all jurisdictions. Lockdowns were severe in India, slowing down economic activity and contracting GDP, relative to other countries. The decline in GDP contributed considerably to the increase in CIC as a percentage of GDP for India in 2020. Among the benchmarked countries, only Hong Kong (21.3%) and Japan (22.9%) had a higher ratio of CIC as a percentage of GDP as compared to India. A low crime rate, years of ultra-low interest rates, and a nationwide network of ATMs have made cash appealing in Japan, giving people few reasons to shift to other modes of payments."

    "output": "In India, retail payment systems drive the volume of payment transactions and the large value system, viz. RTGS, takes the major share in terms of value. RTGS also facilitates customer transactions whose individual transaction value is comparable to other retail payment systems; hence, these transactions have been considered as retail payments. The ratio is low for India as retail payments primarily comprise large volume and low value transactions. In 2020, the volume of payment systems transactions in India grew strongly at a CAGR of 21% between 2017 and 2020, indicating rapid adoption of non -cash payment modes, and payment systems transactions in India grew by 24.4% in 2020 over the previous year."

    "output": "In 2021, India brought all bank branches under the image-based CTS clearing mechanism ensuring T+1 settlement for all instruments across the country. To provide additional security, a mechanism of positive pay was made available for all high value cheques, i.e., above \u20b9 50,000. Globally, most countries have a cheque clearing house in place, often with central bank involvement. Cheques are standardized in many jurisdictions with automated cheque processing. In India, the \"CTS-2010\" standard prescribes mandatory features such as paper quality, watermark, and invisible ink. Implementation of pan-India CTS has enhanced operational efficiency and faster cheque collection and settlement, improving customer service. While risk management practices for cheque processing are relatively weak globally, the use of cheques persists for high-value transactions. To enhance customer safety and reduce fraud from cheque tampering, India introduced positive pay in 2021, requiring reconfirmation of key details for large value cheques. The issuer submits cheque details electronically to the drawee bank, which are cross-checked with the presented cheque by CTS."

India recorded a CAGR of 1% in debit card issuance between 2017 and 2020, despite 150 million debit cards going out of the market due to the planned migration from magnetic strip cards to EMV chip and PIN based cards in 2019. In terms of credit card issuance, India demonstrated a strong CAGR of 17.2% between 2017 and 2020. The growth in credit cards can be attributed to innovative products, co-branded partnerships (such as those of non -bank financial companies (NBFCs) / Fintech Companies with banks), and e-commerce."

However, they are increasingly being used to conduct other activities like card-to-card transfers, bill payments, etc., obviating the need to visit a bank branch and thereby acting as a means of undertaking \u2018digital transactions\u2019 albeit at a restricted scale. In India, authorised non-bank entities are also permitted to deploy ATMs, known as White Label ATMs to support proliferation of ATM infrastructure across the country.\n\nAs at the end of 2020, 233 thousand ATMs were deployed across India, with approximately 11 thousand new ATMs deployed between 2017 and 2020. This is significantly lower than the 53 thousand and 116 thousand new ATMs deployed by China and Russia, respectively, during the same period.\n\nIn India, account holders in rural areas often withdraw cash from PoS terminals with Business Correspondents (BCs) and merchants in their neighborhood, which act as \u201cmicro-ATMs\u201d. These BCs use AePS, which allows online interoperable transactions at micro-ATMs using Aadhaar-based authentication. As at end December 2020, there were close to 356 thousand micro-ATMs deployed in India.\n\nIn China, customer demand was the main driver of growth in ATMs and the government encourages the deployment of ATMs provision as they attract new cardholders. Further, China has also deployed Interactive Teller Machines (ITM) wherein a video facilitates user interaction with a teller on a screen. ITMs provide convenience for customers similar to an in-branch experience but through a digital screen."

While a higher number of cash withdrawals at ATMs per capita indicates higher dependence on cash, cash withdrawals are likely to depend on the ATM density as well, and limited availability of ATMs may impact the number of withdrawals. Further, disruptions caused by the Covid pandemic and restrictions in place on public movement have lowered cash withdrawals in most jurisdictions (except Indonesia). In India, in addition to a low ATM density where a single ATM caters to over 5800 people as at end 2020, there is a restriction on the number of free ATM transactions (financial and non-financial) per month.

The domestic card networks are observed to dominate the share of card usage in China (99%), France (84%), Germany (37%) and Saudi Arabia (45%). In India, there has been a significant growth in the usage of RuPay cards in the recent past.\nJurisdictions with a domestic card network are usually observed to promote the usage of domestic cards for transactions and establish tie-ups with international card schemes for international transactions. The domestic card network in India received a fillip from the Central Government\u2019s efforts to support financial inclusion by promoting issuance of Rupay debit cards to Basic Savings Bank Deposit (BSBD) account holders. In addition, to promote its usage, MDR has been waived for RuPay debit cards.\nNPCI is working on building regional partnerships to enhance the international acceptance of RuPay Cards. NPCI's alliance with international network partners (China Union Pay (CUP), Discover Financial Services (DFS) and Japan Credit Bureau (JCB)) has paved the way for international acceptance of RuPay. RuPay co-branded international cards using DFS & JCBI BINs are accepted at over 195 countries. Further, NPCI has entered into arrangements with Bhutan and Singapore to accept RuPay cards without co-branding with other international card schemes. This is expected to promote more demand for RuPay cards by residents, boosting its market share."

    "output": "Large value payment systems are systemically important Financial Market Infrastructures (FMIs) that are critical elements of a country\u2019s national payment system. Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) facilitates real time large value fund transfers on a gross settlement basis, which helps reduce credit risk. Gross settlement is liquidity intensive and requires payment, irrespective of its nature, to be pre-funded to ensure settlement. In view of the significance of RTGS, countries have adopted different criteria for granting access to this system.\n\nIn most jurisdictions RTGS is owned and operated by the central bank and is used for customer and inter-bank payments. To ensure settlement in central bank money, settlement files of ancillary payment systems are posted to RTGS for final settlement.\n\nRTGS operating hours have a significant impact on the economy as the system processes large value corporate transactions. Extension of operating hours of RTGS can facilitate an increase in market timings. Further, extended availability of RTGS can ensure posting of additional settlement cycles for ancillary payment systems and reduce the build-up of settlement, credit, and default risks, thus enhancing the efficiency of payments ecosystem. A wide overlap in operations of RTGS systems across jurisdictions can also be leveraged to integrate payment systems and enhance cross-border payment arrangements.\n\nIn India, RTGS was made available round the clock from December 14, 2020. This initiative provided increased flexibility for corporates and individuals to undertake payments and ensured posting of additional settlement cycles of ancillary payment systems.\n\nIn India access to RTGS was earlier permitted to domestically located banks, clearing houses and broker dealers. The membership criteria for RTGS was reviewed in July 2021 and Payment System Operators (PSOs), viz. prepaid payment instrument Issuers, card networks and white label ATM operators were permitted to participate in RTGS as direct members. Granting access to non-banks helps reduce costs for members, minimise their dependence on banks, reduce time taken for undertaking payments and eliminates uncertainty in finality of payments. The RTGS system in India, owned and operated by RBI, was introduced in 2004 and has undergone various changes over the years. The RTGS system is running round the clock from December 14, 2020; making India one of the few countries in the world to have its large value payment system operating 24x7."

Across jurisdictions, fast payment systems support multiple functionalities such as bill payments, QR based payments, NFC based payments, request to pay, etc. Fast payment systems are also leveraged to provide non-financial services such as account alias services, balance enquiry, payment scheduling, etc. Various jurisdictions are engaged in establishing linkages between their fast payment systems and payment systems in other jurisdictions to facilitate instant cross-border payments. Jurisdictions have followed different approaches to granting access to non-banks to their fast payment systems with some granting direct access (Mexico, Singapore, United Kingdom) and others permitting indirect access (Australia, Europe, India, Hong Kong). Among the benchmarked countries, only IBPS in China did not permit access to non-banks and only the SPEI system in Mexico followed a hybrid settlement model. The settlement method adopted also varied across systems with some following real time gross settlement and others adopting deferred net settlement. Fast payment systems are driving the overall retail payments in India, at least in terms of volume. Fast payments constituted over 73% of the total retail payment transactions in India in March 2022. UPI alone processed 5.4 billion transactions in March 2022 accounting for 64% of the retail payment transactions. The UPI system powers multiple bank accounts into a single mobile application of any participating bank / non-bank Third Party Application Provider (TPAP).

    "output": "India has implemented a framework that limits the liability of customers in unauthorized electronic banking transactions. To further ensure the safety of customer transactions, several measures have been introduced, including: (a) the facility to switch on/off card transactions, (b) CoF tokenization, (c) mandating LEI for high-value transactions in CPS, and (d) a positive pay system for high-value checks. In the e-commerce environment, where transactions occur online, validating the payer's identity is essential. Card payment networks have established authentication standards to validate the cardholder during card-not-present e-commerce transactions. To enhance the security of card transactions, India mandated in 2020 that card-issuing banks provide customers with the ability to switch on/off and set/modify transaction limits for various types of transactions (domestic and international) at PoS/ATMs/online transactions/contactless transactions, etc. Card networks were also permitted to provide card tokenization services. Furthermore, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has been conducting Electronic Banking Awareness and Training (e-BAAT) programs and digital awareness campaigns, including the \"RBI Kehta Hai\" program, to disseminate information about safe digital banking."

    "input": "Question: What are the authentication standard features for worldwide 3D Secure (versions 1.0.2 and 2.0), EMVCo, India PaySecure, and China UnionPay Online?",
    "output": "The authentication standard features are as follows:\n\nWorldwide 3D Secure:\n3D Secure is based on the communication of XML messages across a secured channel, using the Internet Security Protocol, SSL/TLS. To use a 3D Secure service, the cardholder has to enrol for the service, by associating an authentication value, such as a pass word, with their payment card. The merchant also has to implement the use of 3D Secure within its site, by installing a Merchant Plug-in (MPI). One of the main selling points of 3D Secure 1.0.2 is that it offers the merchant full liability shift against fraudulent transactions. If a user has to pass through another layer of authentication to authorise a transaction, it is less likely that the card would be used in a fraudulent manner.\n\nWorldwide 3D Secure 2.0:\nThe specification of 3D Secure 2.0 has been built to provide support for mobile payments, integration with browsers and mobile apps, risk-based security, multi -factor authentication, and e -Money. The 3DS 2.0 authentication process is also complemented by the use of tokens, which are one-time use credit card numbers. To facilitate risk-based authentication by the issuer, 3DS 2.0 captures a varying amount of payer and device information, depending upon market or regional mandates to restrict sending of this information (such as device ID, MAC address, SIM card details, etc.), known as 'rich data'. The information collected, including cardholder and transaction details, is encrypted and sent to the card scheme's directory server where the data is decrypted, validated and then passed on to the card issuer (ACS). Based on this rich data, the issuer conducts a risk assessment in order to make a decision as to whether the person performing the online transaction is authorised to use the payment card. Implementation of 3D Secure 2.0 is being supported through the EMVCo community and in collaboration with the PCI Security Standards Council (PCI SSC), who will be using the new specification as part of its information security requirements framework.\n\nWorldwide EMVCo:\nIt is a consortium comprising American Express, Discover, JCB, Mastercard, UnionPay and Visa. EMVCo facilitates worldwide interoperability and acceptance of secure payment transactions within the payment industry. It also manages EMV, a technical standard for smart payment cards introduced in 1994 by EuroPay, Mastercard, and Visa, with the goal of reducing physical card fraud.\n\nIndia PaySecure:\nThe PaySecure authentication measures are set up during card registration for the service and are \u201crules\u201d based. The rules set the level of authentication required. For online transactions under a certain value, the payer will be required to authenticate using the two -factor authentication method, in the form of an image and a passphrase, followed by the card's PIN. For transactions over a certain limit, prior to entering the card's PIN, cardholders will be required to enter a one -time password (OTP) that is sent to their registered mobile number or email address or device. An anti-phishing mechanism is also available, allowing the user to check their last three online purchases during the transaction. In addition, NPCI, as a business and technical associate of EMVCo, is able to participate in EMVCo working groups for the creation, development, promotion and implementation of international standards, including the design and development of the 3D Secure 2.0 protocol.\n\nChina UnionPay Online:\nUnionPay provides two cardholder authentication systems for the domestic market, SecurePay and ExpressPay.

    "output": "For UnionPay Payments (UPOP), when payers are registered for SecurePay, they are redirected to the issuing bank's site to authenticate themselves using the OTP sent to their mobile number. ExpressPay authentication is performed at the merchant site and also involves the use of an OTP sent to the payer's mobile number. For the international market, UnionPay cards operate in the same way as standard cards in the payment systems of their co-brands. The MIR card, which utilises a flavour of 3DS 1.0.2 compatible with Visa's standard for cardholder authentication, was released by the Russian Central Bank's subsidiary, NSPK, to combat sanctions imposed by Europe and the USA, and prevent any other external economic or political factors from influencing the in-country processing of card payments."

    "output": "Table 36 outlines the Ombudsman schemes in various countries.  In Australia, the Australian Financial Complaints Authority (AFCA), established in 2018, operates as a Not-for-Profit Company authorized by the Treasury Law Amendment (Putting Consumers First \u2013 Establishment of the Australian Financial Complaints Authority) Act 2018 (AFCA Act), acting as an independent Ombudsman handling complaints related to banking, insurance, investments, and financial advice. The United Kingdom's Financial Ombudsman Service, established in 2001 with statutory backing by the Financial Services and Markets Act, 2000, addresses complaints related to most financial services, including banking, insurance, pensions, savings, investments, cards, and money transfers. Canada's Ombudsman for Banking Services and Investments, initially a Banking Ombudsman in 1996, expanded its scope to include mutual funds and investments in 2002, though its recommendations are not binding.  In France, the ACPR ( Prudential Control and Resolution Authority) suggests mediators / courts for dispute resolution because it has no jurisdiction for dispute resolution. Germany's BaFin (Federal Financial Supervisory Authority), established in 2002, acts as a supervisor and regulator for the Banking, Insurance, and Securities industries. South Africa has an independent Ombudsman for Banking Services, established in 1997, who can issue binding determinations. In the United States of America, the Customer Assistance Group (Comptroller of Currency) helps ensure fair access and equal treatment by assisting customers with questions and complaints, and providing advisories on rights, banking rules, and risks; the Comptroller of Currency is an independent bureau of the Department of Treasury. Russia's Financial Ombudsman Service, set up by the Bank of Russia in 2018 with statutory backing (Federal Law of June 4, 2018), covers various financial institutions, including insurance, credit institutions, pawn shops, and pension funds."

    "output": "A comparison of similar schemes across countries shows that India is one of the few countries where the entire gamut of digital payment transactions is covered under the Ombudsman scheme. The Ombudsman schemes in other countries do not appear to focus on digital payment transactions. The Ombudsman in many jurisdictions is funded by industry participants, which does not engender trust among the consumers. Further, in some jurisdictions such as Canada the Ombudsman does not have the power to issue binding directions. In addition, to build customer confidence in the payment systems and safeguard the interest of the consumers, RBI mandated large non-bank PPI issuers to put in place an Internal Ombudsman Scheme. The scheme was intended to ensure that majority of the complaints of customers are redressed at the level of the PSO itself by an authority placed at the highest level of the PSOs grievance redressal mechanism."

    "output": "CCIL operates as a CCP and provides guaranteed clearing and settlement for transactions in money, Government securities, foreign exchange and derivative markets. It is essential for CCPs to have appropriate risk management practices in place. In the case of CCIL, participant credit exposures are covered through multilateral netting, DvP / PvP settlements and margin collection. Market risk is managed by using margining models for all products. Initial margin is collected to cover potential future exposures while intra-day and end of day MTM margin is collected to cover current exposures. CCIL undertakes back-testing of margining models and stress testing daily to assess adequacy of resources and procedures are in place to call for additional default fund contributions based on the stress test results.\n\nLosses due to participant defaults are handled by pre-funded resources comprising member contributed default fund and CCIL\u2019s contribution from its Settlement Reserve Fund (SRF). CCIL\u2019s skin in the game for each segment is set at 25% of the default fund contribution but not less than the highest individual member contribution for the segment, which is higher than most other CCPs. CCIL\u2019s total skin in the game across all segments is capped at the balance in the SRF. Further, a Contingency Reserve Fund (CRF) has been put in place by CCIL to take care of losses arising out of non-default events."

    "output": "In India, the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007 has designated and confers upon RBI the right to regulate and supervise payment systems within the country. In 2020, RBI published the updated oversight framework for FMIs and RPSs that details the oversight objectives and supervisory processes of RBI as well as the assessment methodology of FMIs and SWIPS under PFMIs. Oversight of payment and settlement systems is a central bank function whereby the objectives of safety and efficiency are promoted by monitoring existing and planned systems, assessing them against these objectives and, where necessary, inducing change. The three key ways in which oversight activity is carried out are through (i) monitoring existing and planned systems; (ii) assessment of the FMIs and RPSs against the oversight objectives; and (iii) inducing change for improvements, where necessary.  The off-site surveillance and monitoring of FMIs and authorised RPSs is conducted by way of various tools, such as (a) submission of prescribed data / information by the regulated entities, (b) fraud monitoring / system of alerts, (c) regular meetings with authorised PSOs, (d) market intelligence, and (e) oversight reports and surveys. Onsite inspection / audit complements the offsite monitoring and surveillance mechanism put in place for the FMIs / RPSs. The onsite inspection activity is based on the risk profile of the entity derived from the annual self-assessment carried out by the entity and the information furnished by the entity and market intelligence, if any. FMIs and RPSs are subjected to periodic onsite inspection as determined by RBI from time to time."

In India, the Indo Nepal Remittance Scheme utilizes NEFT for transfers to Nepal, and the Money Transfer Service Scheme (MTSS) partners with overseas money transfer companies. RBI, along with the Government and NPCI, aims to expand the global reach of UPI. RBI has also selected cross-border payments as the second cohort under the Regulatory Sandbox initiative. Finally, RBI operated CPSs, viz. RTGS and NEFT operating round the clock, the required infrastructure is available which can be leveraged to interface with similar systems in other jurisdictions to facilitate cross-border payments, including remittances.

    "output": "Business Continuity Management (BCM) has hitherto meant protecting organisations against events like natural calamities, geo-political disturbances, cyber-attacks and other disruptions that have the potential of interrupting smooth functioning of an organisation. An unknown virus, i.e., coronavirus, of the size of 0.125 microns, unleashed a once in a century pandemic and completely redefined our understanding of BCM. At risk this time were lives, livelihoods, systems and processes and, especially for regulators like the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), potential systemic disruptions in market infrastructure, cyber systems, business processes and operations, communication and availability of skilled personnel. The RBI mobilized on an unprecedented scale and speed to put in place a cross-functional response that ensured the discharge of all responsibilities and mandates effectively without compromising on the well-being of its employees and their families. Throughout these troubled times, RBI had to (a) continually assess and revalidate its readiness for uninterrupted operations; (b) leverage varied data feeds for continuous monitoring; (c) consider consequences and impacts of its measures; and (d) design and implement rapid but co-ordinated responses across verticals. The RBI also proactively communicated through public statements and in other forms of guidance, reassuring the public at large about the stability and resilience of the financial system while supporting banks and financial institutions and the economy as a whole. The basic message was: RBI is tirelessly at work to shield the Indian economy from the pandemic. From creating a globally acknowledged bio-bubble to keeping payment and settlement and treasury operations running glitch-free, to introducing innovative monetary and liquidity instruments, to taking care of its over 13000 employees and their families by extending adequate support, financial or otherwise, to ensuring adequate availability of currency in the country, RBI was at the frontline, ceaselessly nurturing India\u2019s financial system and ensuring that it successfully sails through uncharted waters."

Therefore, safeguarding the health and well-being of its employees was of paramount importance to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), and various measures were taken in this direction. To safeguard the health of its employees and also contain the spread of COVID-19, the concept of Work from Home (WFH) was introduced for the first time in RBI, even before a nationwide lockdown was imposed by the Government of India (GoI). All the regional offices of RBI (ROs) were advised to work with bare minimum staff, and steps were taken to obtain special permission from various authorities to ensure that persons associated with entities authorized by RBI for operating critical payment systems could access their workplaces (other than the centralized payment systems (CPS), which is dealt with subsequently)."

Some of these are enumerated below:\na) A Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for reporting of COVID -19 cases was issued, clarifying on the quarantine requirements and WFH during the quarantine period . The SOP facilitated coordinated reporting of COVID -19 cases across RBI and contained general advisory for nodal officers of CODs and ROs on matters pertaining to COVID-19.\nb) To effectively follow the policy of test, track and treat, various Rapid Antigen Testing and Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction ( RTPCR) testing camps were conducted across the offices of RBI.\nc) RBI introduced dedicated isolation arrangements for employees and dependent family members with hospitals in various centres for quarantine requirements. This was later extended to staff of service providers working on critical operations.\nd) A dedicated \u2018Home Care Package \u2019 was introduced for COVID -19 infected employees and family members. \ne) In case of mild symptoms which did not require hospitalisation, home quarantine was advised as per government guidelines. \nf) With the possibility of children being infected in the third wave of COVID-19, specialised children\u2019s hospitals were empanelled for direct settlement. \ng) Wherever necessary, powers were delegated to ensure frictionless admission to hospitals.\nh) ROs having arrangement with local empanelled service providers, were advised to provide medicines to retirees at their doorstep. \ni) Medical facilities were extended to part-time / contractual doctors (BMO / BMC) and pharmacists of RBI as a welfare measure in view of their role as frontline workers during the pandemic.\nj) Settlement of bills for COVID -19 related medical charges were permitted beyond the rates prescribed under the medical schedule in view of the increased rates due to demand-supply mismatches. \nk) In view of COVID-19 cases being reported regularly, quarantine facilities were arranged in the residential colonies for staff and their family members.\nl) During the 2nd wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, ROs were advised to purchase oxygen concentrators for dispensaries, to counter the shortage in hospitals."

After the availability of vaccines, vaccines were provided centrally from pharmaceutical companies for Mumbai and a few other centres. In addition, Regional Offices (ROs) tied up with various hospitals for vaccinating staff and their dependent family members. Several COVID-19 vaccination camps were conducted at the premises of RBI and its residential colonies. The staff and their family members were sensitised to get vaccinated at the earliest. At Mumbai, 50 vaccination camps were organised across RBI\u2019s residential colonies and at Mumbai Regional Office (MRO), and more than 14,500 people were vaccinated in these camps. Volunteer teams were formed for each day of vaccination. This mammoth task included various challenges such as procurement of vaccines and tie-ups with hospitals, obtaining speedy approvals from Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai, maintaining huge data of details of employees and their family members, and so on. It was ensured that all service providers, contract workers, support staff, and drivers being deputed for duty were also vaccinated in the various vaccination camps."

    "output": "To perform critical functions with zero downtime, RBI established a secured, quarantine environment called a 'Bio-Bubble' for all Data Centers. Approximately 200 key staff members, including RBI officials and support teams, were isolated at a separate facility near the three Data Centers. This setup, implemented rapidly before the nationwide lockdown, facilitated the uninterrupted operation of centralized payment systems like RTGS and NEFT (running 24x7x365), treasury functions, core banking solutions (eKuber), government and internal accounts, and currency management. Highest priority was given to safety, health, and social distancing.\n\nThe Top Management, including the Governor, maintained high morale among quarantined staff by providing encouragement and assurances of support for their families. Staff rotations occurred every fortnight after thorough screening by in-house doctors, sustaining employee welfare and unhindered operations over 538 days. Furthermore, during the pandemic, RBI adopted the approach of BEAT-UP-COVID, viz., Benchmarking, Administration, Tweaking, Up-gradation, Paediatric care, Calibrating, Organisation, Vaccinating, Involving and De-stressing, by setting up a COVID -19 Response Group (CRG) to provide help on a real time basis to tackle the third wave of COVID -19 pandemic.

The Reserve Bank Staff College (RBSC) and Zonal Training Centers (ZTCs) shifted to online training sessions. Important applications like Bloomberg terminal, Refinitiv Eikon, Cogencis, and Negotiated Dealing System - Order Matching (NDS-OM) were made available over the internet, and two-factor authentication (2FA) was configured on official laptops for secure remote access to RBI\u2019s IT applications. Internal meetings of the Inter-Departmental Group (IDG) on growth and inflation and the Commodity Price Monitoring Group (CPMG) transitioned to online interactions. Landline contact numbers at CoDs were diverted to officials' mobile handsets to ensure continuity. To manage currency, the RBI addressed challenges in undisrupted functioning of currency-related activities and ensuring adequate currency availability. Measures included advising paper mills and printing presses to monitor raw material inventory and activate Business Continuity Plans (BCPs), closely monitoring stock and withdrawal patterns of notes, and ensuring adequate supply of banknotes and coins to the public through dedicated trains and airlifting of currency."

    "output": "To ensure speedier and timely supply of banknotes, increased emphasis was accorded towards direct remittances from printing presses to CCs. Availability of cash in ATMs across the country was monitored by RBI on a daily basis to ensure timely replenishment, which involved close coordination between RBI, cash-in-transit companies and the government. To tackle the accumulation of soiled notes and freeing up space in CCs, the ROs operated CVPS and the shredding and briquetting system (SBS) machines in extended hours and night shifts, wherever required. The process pertaining to remittances of fresh notes (from presses to ROs of RBI, from ROs to currency chests and direct remittances to currency chests) was rationalised which reduced both the time involved in the remittance of currency and human intervention while handling currency. In March 2020, the policy repo rate was reduced by 75 basis points to 4.40 per cent. It was decided to maintain the accommodative stance of monetary policy as long as considered necessary to revive growth, mitigate the impact of COVID -19, while ensuring that inflation remained within the target. The fixed rate reverse repo rate, which sets the floor of the Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) corridor, was reduced by 90 basis points to 4.00 per cent, thus creating an asymmetric corridor. In April 2020, the fixed rate reverse repo rate was reduced by 25 basis points to 3.75 per cent. In May 2020, the repo rate was cut by another 40 basis points to 4.00."

These were for tenors of one year and three years, respectively.\nb) In view of the tightening of financial conditions as reflected in the hardening of yields and widening of spreads, RBI conducted regular Open Market Operations (OMO) to ensure that the yield curve evolved in an orderly manner.\nc) Secondary market G-sec acquisition programme (G-SAP) was announced, under which RBI committed upfront to a specific amount of open market purchases of government securities. Overall, net liquidity injected through OMO purchases, including G-SAP, amounted to \u20b93.13 lakh crore during 2020\u201321 and \u20b92.10 lakh crore during 2021-22.\nd) In order to distribute liquidity more evenly across the yield curve and improve transmission, 22 auctions of operation twists (OTs) were conducted during 2020-21 and 2021-22."

This reduction in CRR released primary liquidity of about \u20b91,37,000 crore uniformly across the banking system. Furthermore, the requirement of minimum daily CRR balance maintenance was reduced from 90 percent to 80 percent, which was in effect until September 25, 2020. SCBs were also allowed exemption from maintenance of cash reserve ratio (CRR) on incremental credit disbursed by them between January 31 and July 31, 2020, on retail loans for automobiles, residential housing, and loans to MSMEs.\n\ng) Under the MSF, banks could, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, borrow overnight at their discretion by dipping up to 2 percent into the Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR). To provide comfort to the banking system, the limit was increased from 2 percent to 3 percent of their NDTL effective March 27, 2020. This measure was available up to December 31, 2021. This provided comfort to the banking system by allowing it to avail an additional \u20b91,37,000 crore of liquidity under the LAF window in times of stress.\n\nh) Targeted Long-Term Repo Operations (TLTROs) were announced on March 27, 2020, for a cumulative amount of \u20b91 lakh crore. Liquidity availed by banks under the scheme was required to be deployed in investment-grade corporate bonds, commercial paper, and non-convertible debentures {including Mutual Funds and Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC)} over and above the outstanding level of their investments in these bonds as of March 27, 2020. TLTRO 2.0 was announced on April 17, 2020, for tenors up to three years."

    "output": "China:\nWith COVID-19 containment as the top priority, the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBC) focused its efforts on supporting the recovery and development of the real economy and used a mix of tools to combat the shocks from the pandemic. Firstly, work was done to keep liquidity adequate at a reasonable level. Since the beginning of 2020, PBC had released RMB 1.75 trillion worth of long-term funds by cutting the required reserve ratio (RRR) three times, and after the Spring Festival PBC injected RMB 1.7 trillion of short-term liquidity. By rationally calibrating the intensity and pace of open market operations (OMOs), PBC ensured stable operations of the financial market. Secondly, money and credit support was intensified to combat the impact of COVID-19. PBC launched RMB 300 billion in special central bank lending for key areas and enterprises engaged in pandemic containment, provided RMB 500 billion of special quotas for central bank lending and central bank discounts to support the resumption of work and production, and increased the quotas for central bank lending and central bank discounts by an additional RMB 1 trillion to facilitate the economic recovery and development. Thirdly, reform measures were adopted to smoothen the transmission of monetary policy. PBC proceeded with market-based interest rate reforms, promoted application of loan prime rate (LPR), and facilitated the shift in the pricing benchmark for outstanding floating-rate loans so as to lower the real interest rates on loans.\n\nEuropean Union:\nEuropean Central Bank (ECB) had put in place a set of monetary policy measures to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the euro area economy and to provide support to all European citizens. It had kept key interest rates at historically low levels as a result of which borrowing costs remained low. It launched a new temporary asset purchase programme of private and public sector securities to counter the serious risks to the monetary policy transmission mechanism and the outlook for the euro area posed by the outbreak and escalating diffusion of COVID-19. This new Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP) had an overall envelope of \u20ac750 billion which was later increased to a total of \u20ac1,850 billion. ECB increased the amount of money that banks could borrow and made it easier for them to borrow specifically to provide loans to those hardest-hit by the spread of COVID-19, including small and medium-sized firms. One of the ways borrowing was made easier was by easing standards for the collateral that banks gave to ECB. ECB announced a package of temporary collateral easing measures to facilitate the availability of eligible collateral for Eurosystem counterparties to participate in liquidity providing operations, such as the targeted longer-term refinancing operations. The package was complementary to other measures announced by ECB, including additional longer-term refinancing operations and PEPP. The measures collectively supported bank lending especially by easing the conditions at which credit claims were accepted as collateral. Simultaneously, the Eurosystem also increased its risk tolerance to support the provision of credit via its refinancing operations, particularly by lowering collateral valuation haircuts for all assets consistently."

    "output": "In Sweden, where the repo rate was already at zero, limiting the scope for rate cuts, broad and targeted asset purchases were carried out by Riksbank to keep interest rates low. These purchases aimed to hold down risk premia and interest rates, facilitating new paper issuance. The Riksbank also offered to lend SEK (Swedish Krona) to banks for on-lending to corporates, alongside supplementary measures like weekly market operations at longer maturities, amendments to overnight interest terms, and increased flexibility regarding collateral. Furthermore, the Federal Reserve signed swap agreements with the Riksbank to enhance dollar liquidity for Swedish banks. In Australia, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) lowered the target for the policy interest rate to 0.1 percent and committed not to increase it until actual inflation was sustainably within the 2 to 3 percent target range. The RBA targeted a yield of 0.10 percent on the Australian Government Bond expiring in April 2024 and purchased government bonds in the secondary market, employing quantitative easing (QE). Additionally, banks borrowed funds from RBA for 3 years at the policy interest rate to make loans to businesses and households."

    "output": "To strengthen business continuity planning arrangements and to remain in operational readiness, alternative emergency back-up sites were identified at various RBI office locations in Mumbai and elsewhere. Further, back-up resources having prior experience of conducting auctions and related activities were identified from alternate offices. To provide greater comfort to the central and state governments in undertaking COVID-19 containment and mitigation measures, and to enable them to plan their market borrowings, the WMA limit was enhanced. The limit for WMA of the GoI for the remaining part of first half of the financial year 2020-21 (April 2020 to September 2020) was revised from \u20b91,20,000 crore to \u20b92,00,000 crore. The WMA limit for GoI for the second half of 2020-21 was fixed at \u20b91,25,000 crore, an increase of 257 per cent over the previous half year (second half of 2019-20). Several state governments created and maintained a Consolidated Sinking Fund (CSF) to facilitate redemption of state\u2019s market loans in an orderly manner and to increase their credibility in raising loans at lower rates in future through auctions. The scheme for constitution and administration of CSF for state government was reviewed and the rules governing withdrawal from CSF were relaxed, while ensuring that a sizeable corpus is retained in the Fund."

    "output": "To alleviate the impact of COVID-19 on the banking system, several regulatory measures were announced, consistent with globally coordinated action committed to by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS). Measures were initiated to mitigate the burden of debt servicing and to ensure the continuity of viable businesses. The salient features of these measures included rescheduling of payments for term loans and working capital facilities, easing of working capital financing, and exemption from classification of special mention account (SMA) and Non-Performing Assets (NPA) on account of implementation of the above measures. Based on the review and empirical analysis of counter cyclical capital buffer (CCyB) indicators, it was decided not to activate CCyB for a period of one year, i.e., till April 2021, and subsequently, it was decided that it was not necessary to activate CCyB at that point in time. It was decided that in respect of all accounts for which lending institutions decide to grant moratorium or deferment, and which were \u2018standard\u2019 as on March 1, 2020, the 90-days NPA norm shall exclude the moratorium period, i.e., there would be an asset classification standstill for all such accounts from March 1, 2020, to May 31, 2020. At the same time, with the objective of ensuring that banks maintain sufficient buffers and remain adequately provisioned to meet future challenges, they will have to maintain a higher provision of 10 per cent on all such accounts under the standstill, spread over two quarters, i.e., March 2020 and June 2020. These provisions were allowed to be adjusted later against the provisioning requirements for actual slippages in such accounts. Under RBI\u2019s prudential framework for the resolution of stressed assets dated June 7, 2019, in case of large accounts under default, scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) were required to hold an additional provision of 20 per cent if a resolution plan was not implemented within 210 days from the date of such default. Recognising the challenges to the resolution of stressed assets in the then volatile environment, it was decided to extend the period for implementation of the resolution plan by 90 days. Further extension of the resolution timelines was provided after a review on account of continued challenges to the resolution of stressed assets in a volatile environment. A window for the resolution of COVID-19 related stress was applicable to all commercial banks (including small finance banks, local area banks, and regional rural banks), all primary (Urban) co-operative banks / state co-operative banks / district central co-operative banks, NBFCs (including housing finance companies), and all."

The resolution framework was to be invoked not later than December 31, 2020 and had to be implemented within 90 days of invocation in respect of personal loans and 180 days of invocation for other eligible loan exposures.\n\nAdditionally, to conserve capital of banks to retain their capacity to support the economy and absorb losses in an environment of heightened uncertainty, scheduled commercial banks were directed not to make any further dividend pay-outs from profits pertaining to the financial year ended March 31, 2020 until further instructions. This restriction was to be reviewed based on the financial position of banks for the quarter ended September 30, 2020.

    "output": "The Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) requirement for SCBs was reduced from 100 per cent to 80 per cent with effect from April 17, 2020. This requirement was gradually restored in two phases, viz., 90 per cent by October 1, 2020 and 100 per cent by April 1, 2021. Considering the potential stress on account of COVID-19, the implementation of the last tranche of 0.625 per cent of the Capital Conservation Buffer (CCB) was deferred from March 31, 2020 to September 30, 2020 and then till October 1, 2021. The last tranche was implemented with effect from October 1, 2021. The interest equalisation scheme on pre and post shipment rupee export credit was extended by the government of India for one year, i.e., up to March 31, 2021, with same scope and coverage. To facilitate greater flow of resources to corporates, a bank\u2019s exposure under the Large Exposure Framework to a group of connected counterparties was increased from 25 per cent to 30 per cent of the eligible capital base of the bank. Banks were also permitted certain relaxations related to MSME loans and LTV ratios for gold loans."

It curtailed market trading hours for RBI-regulated financial markets and restored them in phases as pandemic-related constraints eased. To provide greater flexibility in complying with regulatory requirements, the RBI:\n(a) Allowed foreign portfolio investors under the voluntary retention route (VRR) an additional three months to meet investment commitments for debt securities allotted between January 24, 2020, and April 30, 2020.\n(b) Extended the timeline for implementing the legal entity identifier (LEI) in non-derivative financial markets from March 31, 2020, to September 30, 2020.\n(c) Deferred the implementation date for directions on hedging foreign exchange risk (dated April 7, 2020) from June 1, 2020, to September 1, 2020. Furthermore, the submission of Form A and VII returns to RBI using digital signatures was introduced to ensure the timely publication of press communique statements. Primary (urban) co-operative banks (UCBs), state co-operative banks and central co-operative banks were given until September 30, 2021 (extended from June 30, 2021), to submit their returns to RBI due to difficulties in finalizing their Annual Accounts.

    "output": "Communication has gained importance although it works both ways \u2013 while too much of communication can confuse the market, too little may keep it guessing about the central bank\u2019s policy intent. Therefore, central banks have to tread a very fine line. RBI has been mindful of the importance of communication during this period given its multifarious responsibilities and wider ramifications of its actions. Governor and Deputy Governors held regular meetings with the managing directors (MDs) and chief executive officers (CEOs) of major regulated entities. RBI ensured all channels of communication were kept open with major players in the financial system. As two-way communication is important for making informed policy decisions, RBI held detailed interactions with analysts, economists, researchers, banks, academic bodies and research institutions, trade and industry associations, and several others for monetary policy and other policy actions. This enabled building a confidence channel through communication and instilled wider confidence in RBI\u2019s policies. Beginning March 2020, several BCP resilience measures were taken, which inter alia, included: a) Critical website operations relating to timely updation of content on RBI\u2019s website were shifted to PDC and the staff deputed there were assigned the following responsibilities: i) Co-ordination with IRIS Business Services Limited staff for timely updation and uploading of various documents on RBI\u2019s website. ii) Technical issues were handled in co-ordination with Reserve Bank Information Technology Private Limited (ReBIT), IRIS and the Department of Information Technology."

    "output": "Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) is a digital form of currency notes issued by a central bank. While most central banks across the globe are exploring the issuance of CBDC, the key motivations for its issuance are specific to each country\u2019s unique requirements. This Concept Note explains the objectives, choices, benefits and risks of issuing a CBDC in India, referred to as e\u20b9 (digital Rupee). The e\u20b9 will provide an additional option to the currently available forms of money. It is substantially not different from banknotes, but being digital it is likely to be easier, faster and cheaper. It also has all the transactional benefits of other forms of digital money. The purpose behind the issue of this Concept Note is to create awareness about CBDCs in general and the planned features of the digital Rupee, in particular. The Note also seeks to explain Reserve Bank\u2019s approach towards introduction of the digital Rupee. Reserve Bank\u2019s approach is governed by two basic considerations \u2013 to create a digital Rupee that is as close as possible to a paper currency and to manage the process of introducing digital Rupee in a seamless manner. The Concept Note also discusses key considerations such as technology and design choices, possible uses of digital rupee, issuance mechanisms etc. It examines the implications of introduction of CBDC on the banking system, monetary policy, financial stability, and analyses privacy issues. The Reserve Bank will soon commence limited pilot launches of e\u20b9 for specific use cases. It is expected that this note would facilitate a deeper appreciation and understanding of digital Rupee and help members of public prepare for its use."

    "output": "Management of currency is one of the core central banking functions of the Reserve Bank for which it derives the necessary statutory powers from Section 22 of the RBI Act, 1934. Along with the Government of India, the Reserve Bank is responsible for the design, production and overall management of the nation\u2019s currency, with the goal of ensuring an adequate supply of clean and genuine notes in the economy.\n\nThe history of money is fascinating and goes back thousands of years. From the early days of bartering to the first metal coins and eventually the first paper money, it has always had an important impact on the way we function as a society. The innovations in money and finance go hand in hand with the shifts in monetary history. In its evolution till date, currency has taken several different forms. It has traversed its path from barter, to valuable metal coins made up of bronze and copper which later evolved to be made up of silver and gold. Use of coins was a huge milestone in the history of money because they were one of the first currencies that allowed people to pay by count (number of coins) rather than weight. Somewhere along the way, people improvised by using claims on goods and a bill of exchange.\n\nMoney either has intrinsic value or represents title to commodities that have intrinsic value or title to other debt instruments. In modern economies, currency is a form of money that is issued exclusively by the sovereign (or a central bank as its representative) and is legal tender. Paper currency is such a representative money, and it is essentially a debt instrument. It is a liability of the issuing central bank (and sovereign) and an asset of the holding public.\n\nIrrespective of the form of money, in any economy, money performs three primary functions - medium of exchange, a unit of account and a store of value. Money as a medium of exchange may be used for any transactions wherein goods or services are purchased or sold. Money as a unit of account can be used to value goods or services and express it in monetary terms. Money can also be stored or conserved for future purposes.\n\nIndia has made impressive progress towards innovation in digital payments. India has enacted a separate law for Payment and Settlement Systems which has enabled an orderly development of the payment eco-system in the country. The present state-of-the-art payment systems that are affordable, accessible, convenient, efficient, safe, secure and available 24x7x365 days a year are a matter of pride for the nation. This striking shift in payment preference has been due to the creation of robust round the clock electronic payment systems such as Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) and National Electronic Funds Transfer (NEFT) that has facilitated seamless real time or near real time fund transfers. In addition, the launch of Immediate Payment Service (IMPS) and Unified Payments Interface (UPI) for instant payment settlement, the introduction of mobile based payment systems such as Bharat Bill Payment System (BBPS), and National Electronic Toll Collection (NETC) to facilitate electronic toll payments have been the defining moments that has transformed the payments ecosystem of the country and attracted international recognition. The convenience of these payment systems ensured"

    "input": "Question: What is a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) and what are the motivations for exploring its issuance in India?",
    "output": "The rapid acceptance of digital payments in India has been driven by factors such as providing consumers with an alternative to cash and paper payments, the facilitation of non-bank FinTech firms, and the Reserve Bank's role as a catalyst in developing a safe, secure, sound, efficient, and interoperable payment system. The concept of money has evolved from commodity to metallic currency to paper currency to digital currency, with the digitalization of money being the next milestone. This has led to the development of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). Recent innovations in technology-based payments solutions have prompted central banks to explore the potential benefits and risks of issuing a CBDC. The RBI is working towards a phased implementation strategy, examining use cases for its own CBDC (Digital Rupee (e\u20b9)) with minimal disruption to the financial system. The Reserve Bank broadly defines CBDC as the legal tender issued by a central bank in a digital form, exchangeable at par with the existing currency, and accepted as a medium of payment, legal tender, and a safe store of value. CBDCs would appear as a liability on a central bank\u2019s balance sheet. Key motivations for exploring the issuance of CBDC in India include reduction in operational costs involved in physical cash management, fostering financial inclusion, bringing resilience, efficiency, and innovation in payments system, adding efficiency to the settlement system, boosting innovation in cross-border payments space."

    "output": "The key motivations for exploring the issuance of CBDC in India include reduction in operational costs involved in physical cash management, fostering financial inclusion, bringing resilience, efficiency, and innovation in payments system, adding efficiency to the settlement system, boosting innovation in cross-border payments space and providing public with uses that any private virtual currencies can provide, without the associated risks. The use of offline feature in CBDC would also be beneficial in remote locations and offer availability and resilience benefits when electrical power or mobile network is not available.\n\nPrivate virtual currencies sit at substantial odds to the historical concept of money. They are not commodities or claims on commodities as they have no intrinsic value. The rapid mushrooming of private cryptocurrencies in the last few years has attempted to challenge the fundamental notion of money as we know it. Claiming the benefits of de -centralisation, cryptocurrencies are being hailed as innovation that would usher in de-centralised finance and disrupt the traditional financial system. However, the inherent design of cryptocurrencies is more geared to bypass the established and regulated intermediation and control arrangements that play a crucial role of ensuring integrity and stability of monetary and financial eco-system.\n\nAs the custodian of monetary policy framework and with the mandate to ensure financial stability in the country, the Reserve Bank of India has been consistent in highlighting various risks related to the cryptocurrencies. These digital assets undermine India\u2019s financial and macroeconomic stability because of their negative consequences for the financial sector. Further, a wider proliferation of cryptocurrencies has the potential to diminish monetary authorities\u2019 potential to determine and regulate monetary policy and the monetary system of the country which could pose serious challenge to the stability of the financial system of the country.\n\nIn this context, it is the responsibility of central bank to provide its citizens with a risk free central bank digital money which will provide the user s the same experience of dealing in currency in digital form, without any risks associated with private cryptocurrencies. Therefore, CBDCs will provide the public with benefits of virtual currencies while ensuring consumer protection by avoiding the damaging social and economic consequences of private virtual currencies.\n\nAs CBDCs are electronic form of sovereign currency, it should imbibe all the possible features of physical currency. The design of CBDC is dependent on the functions it is expected to perform, and the design determines its implications for payment systems, monetary policy as well as the structure and stability of the financial system. One of the main considerations is that the design features of CBDCs should be least disruptive.\n\nThe key design choices to be considered for issuing CBDCs include (i) Type of CBDC to be issued (Wholesale CBDC and/or Retail CBDC), (ii) Models for issuance and management of CBDCs (Direct, Indirect or Hybrid model), (iii) Form of CBDC (Token-based or Account-based), (iv) Instrument Design (Remunerated or Non-remunerated) and (v) Degree of Anonymity.\n\nCBDC can be classified into two broad types viz. general purpose or retail (CBDC -R) and wholesale (CBDC-W). Retail CBDC would be potentially available for use by all viz. private sector, non-financial"

    "output": "CBDC can be classified into two broad types viz. general purpose or retail (CBDC -R) and wholesale (CBDC-W). Retail CBDC would be potentially available for use by all viz. private sector, non-financial consumers and businesses while wholesale CBDC is designed for restricted access to select financial institutions. While Wholesale CBDC is intended for the settlement of interbank transfers and related wholesale transactions, Retail CB DC is an electronic version of cash primarily meant for retail transactions.\nIt is believed that Retail CBDC can provide access to safe money for payment and settlement as it is a direct liability of the Central Bank. Wholesale CBDC has the potential to transform the settlement systems for financial transactions and make them more efficient and secure. Going by the potential offered by each of them, there may be merit in introducing both CBDC-W and CBDC-R.\nThere are two models for issuance and management of CBDCs viz. Direct model (Single Tier model) and Indirect model (Two-Tier model). A Direct model would be the one where the central bank is responsible for managing all aspects of the CBDC system viz. issuance, account-keeping and transaction verification. \nIn an Indirect model, central bank and other intermediaries (banks and any other service providers) , each play their respective role. In this model central bank issues CBDC to consumers indirectly through intermediaries and any claim by consumers is managed by the intermediary as the central bank only handles wholesale payments to intermediaries. \nThe Indirect model is akin to the current physical currency management system wherein banks manage activities like distribution of notes to public, account-keeping, adherence of requirement related to know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering and countering the terrorism of financing (AML/CFT) checks, transaction verification etc.\nCBDC can be structured as \u2018token -based\u2019 or \u2018account-based\u2019. A token -based CBDC is a bearer -instrument like banknotes, meaning whosoever holds the tokens at a given point in time would be presumed to own them. In contrast, an account-based system would require maintenance of record of balances and transactions of all holders of the CBDC and indicate the ownership of the monetary balances. Also, in a token-based CBDC, the person receiving a token will verify that his ownership of the token is genuine, whereas in an account-based CBDC , an intermediary verifies the identity of an account holder. Considering the features offered by both the forms of CBDCs, a token-based CBDC is viewed as a preferred mode for CBDC -R as it would be closer to physical cash, while account-based CBDC may be considered for CBDC-W."

    "output": "The technology considerations underlying the deployment of CBDC needs to be forward looking and must have strong cybersecurity, technical stability, resilience and sound technical governance standards. While crystallising the design choices in the initial stages, the technological considerations may be kept flexible and open-ended in order to incorporate the changing needs based on the evolution of the technological aspects of CBDCs.\n\nThe payment of (positive) interest would likely enhance the attractiveness of CBDCs that also serves as a store of value. But, designing a CBDC that moves away from cash-like attributes to a \u201cdeposit-like\u201d CBDC may have a potential for disintermediation in the financial system resulting from loss of deposits by banks, impeding their credit creation capacity in the economy. Also considering that physical cash does not carry any interest, it would be more logical to offer non-interest bearing CBDCs.\n\nFor CBDC to play the role as a medium of exchange, it needs to incorporate all the features that physical currency represents including anonymity, universality, and finality. Ensuring anonymity for a digital currency particularly represents a challenge, as all digital transactions would leave some trail. Clearly, the degree of anonymity would be a key design decision for any CBDC. In this regard, reasonable anonymity for small value transactions akin to anonymity associated with physical cash may be a desirable option for CBDC-R."

    "output": "Recent technological advances have ushered in a wave of new private-sector financial products and services, including digital wallets, mobile payment apps, and new digital assets. While cash is still prevalent, innovations are prompting Central Banks to consider how new central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) could complement or replace traditional money. CBDC is considered a third form of base money, with central banks globally exploring its feasibility, potential benefits, and risks. According to a 2021 Bank for International Settlements (BIS) survey, 90% of central banks are engaged in some form of CBDC work, and over half are developing them or running concrete experiments.\n\nRecognizing these global developments, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) established an Internal Working Group (WG) in October 2020 to study appropriate designs and implementation architectures for introducing CBDCs in India. In its February 2021 report, the WG made several major recommendations, including the need for a robust legal framework to back the issuance of e\u20b9 (Digital Rupee) as another form of currency, amending the RBI Act to cover e\u20b9 in the definition of 'bank note' and insert a new section covering features pertaining to e\u20b9 and necessary exemptions.

It recommended that the design of e\u20b9 should be compatible with the objectives of monetary and financial stability.\niii. The most widespread use and advantage of e\u20b9 was expected to emerge from the token-based variant in the retail segment. Keeping this in mind, the WG recommended undertaking some pilot projects with phased implementation to serve as a learning experience.\niv. Implementation of a specific purpose e\u20b9, one each in the wholesale and retail segments to begin with. The proposed models could be implemented with little or no disruption to the market and help unravel the benefits of CBDC. For Wholesale CBDC (CBDC-W), a phased implementation strategy for wholesale account-based CBDC model, in securities settlement (outright), was proposed. For Retail CBDC (CBDC- R), a token-based CBDC with tiered architecture model was proposed wherein the Reserve Bank shall only issue and redeem e\u20b9 while the distribution and payment services will be delegated to the banks.\nv. As traceability, privacy and transaction costs vary for each CBDC type resulting in different cost implications for each stakeholder, the need to conduct more research on the technological aspects of CBDC implementation on a national scale was recommended.\nvi. The WG was of the view that finalising a model for implementation of e\u20b9 within a short duration may not be desirable and re-iterated that the initial models proposed be simple models that could be considered to commence work in this connection. The WG proposed to continue deliberations on CBDC over a longer period to refine and crystallise requirements for the implementation of other models of e\u20b9 in future."

It could also lead to a more robust, efficient, trusted, regulated, and legal tender-based payments option, including cross-border payments. However, CBDC could also pose risks to financial stability, monetary policy, financial market structure, and the cost and availability of credit. These risks need careful evaluation against the potential benefits. The Government of India announced the launch of the Digital Rupee (CBDC) from FY 2022-23 onwards in the Union Budget on February 01, 2022, aiming for a more efficient and cheaper currency management system using blockchain and other technologies. Amendments to the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, were notified on March 30, 2022, enabling the pilot and subsequent issuance of CBDC. An internal high-level committee on CBDC was also constituted in February 2022 by the Reserve Bank to study various aspects of CBDC and suggest measures for its successful introduction. Based on the deliberations in the Committee, the Reserve Bank released a Concept Note to present the background, motivation, choices of design features and other policy frameworks for the e\u20b9 system for the country, with the aim to build an open, inclusive, interoperable and innovative CBDC system which will meet the aspirations of the modern digital economy of India."

    "output": "Different jurisdictions have justified the adoption of CBDC for diverse reasons, including: (i) Central Banks, faced with dwindling usage of paper currency, seek to popularize a more acceptable electronic form of currency (like Sweden); (ii) Jurisdictions with significant physical cash usage seeking to make issuance more efficient (like Denmark, Germany, Japan or even the US); (iii) Countries with geographical barriers restricting the physical movement of cash had motivation to go for CBDC (e.g. The Bahamas and the Caribbean with small and large numbers of islands spread out); (iv) Central Banks seek to meet the public\u2019s need for digital currencies, manifested in the increasing use of private virtual currencies, and thereby avoid the more damaging consequences of such private currencies. Further, CBDCs have some clear advantages over other digital payments systems, as it being a sovereign currency, ensures settlement finality and thus reduces settlement risk in the financial system. CBDCs could also potentially enable a more real-time, cost-effective seamless integration of cross border payment systems. Also, supported by the state-of-the-art payment systems of India that are affordable, accessible, convenient, efficient, safe and secure, the e\u20b9 system will bolster India\u2019s digital economy, enhance financial inclusion, and make the monetary and payment systems more efficient."

    "input": "Question: What are the motivations for India to consider issuing Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), focusing on cost reduction and the cause of digitization?",
    "output": "There are a large and diverse number of motivations for India to consider CBDC, including the reduction in cost associated with physical cash management. The total expenditure incurred on security printing during April 1, 2021 to March 31, 2022 was \u20b9 4,984.80 crore. This cost, which does not include the Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) cost of printing money, is predominantly borne by general public, businesses, banks, and the Central Bank. CBDC affects the overall value of the money issuing function to the extent that it reduces operational costs e.g. costs related to printing, storage, transportation and replacement of banknotes, and costs associated with delay in reconciliation and settlement. Though, at the outset, establishing a CBDC creation/issuance may entail significant fixed infrastructure costs but subsequent marginal operating costs shall be very low.\nCost-effectiveness of cash management using CBDC vis -\u00e0-vis physical currency provides an additional motivation for introduction of CBDC, which may be also perceived to be environment friendly. Complementing the higher cash requirement of the country , CBDC will lead to lowering of cost as it would obviate the need of many processes associated with distribution of physical currency across the country. Further, given the geographical spread and pockets where making physical cash available is a challenge, CBDC is expected to facilitate seamless transactions.\nAnother motivation is to further the cause of digitisation to achieve a less cash economy. Despite rapid digitisation in the payments space, the growing use of electronic medium of payment has not yet resulted in a reduction in the demand for cash. The percentage increase in value of banknotes during 2020-21 and 2021-22 was 16.8 per cent and 9.9 per cent respectively and the percentage increase in volume of banknotes during 2020-21 and 2021-22 was 7.2 per cent and 5.0 per cent respectively.\nCBDC can be a preferred mode of holding central bank money rather than cash in any uncertain situation like the one of pandemic COVID-19. Further, the preference for cash transactions for regular expenses and small payments for its anonymity, may be redirected to acceptance of CBDC, if reasonable anonymity is assured. This shall further the digitisation process in the country."

    "output": "The digital payments are further deepening and expanding in the country, indicating Indian citizens' appetite for digital payments. Therefore, the digital currency issued by the central bank shall provide yet another option for furthering the cause of digital payment, apart from the range of other digital payment instruments available, given its ease of usage coupled with sovereign guarantee.\nCBDC could further enhance resilience in payments and provide core payment services outside of the commercial banking system. It can provide a new way to make payments and also diversify the range of payment options, particularly for e-commerce (where cash cannot be used, except for the Cash on Delivery (COD) option). The CBDC based payment system is not expected to substitute other modes of existing payment options rather it will supplement by providing another payment avenue to the larger public. As has been the experience with many payment products, once CBDC is introduced, innovations around the product would only expand the choices available and healthy competition will help bringing about both cost and time efficiencies.\nMost payments in a modern economy are made with private money maintained by commercial banks, which are in the form of demand deposits and therefore liabilities of these banks. A key feature of bank deposits is that commercial banks guarantee convertibility on demand to central bank money at a fixed price, namely, at par, thereby maintaining the value of their money. Nevertheless, in a fractional reserve system, a commercial bank \u2014even if solvent\u2014 may face a challenge to meet with any sudden spurt in demand to convert substantial amount of bank deposits to central bank money.\nA significant difference between the central bank money and commercial bank money is that central bank can meet its obligations using its own nonredeemable money, while the latter entails counterparty risk. Central Bank money is the only monetary asset in a domestic economy without credit and liquidity risk. Therefore, it is preferred asset to settle payments in financial market infrastructures.\nTherefore, an e\u20b9 would offer the public broad access to digital money free from credit risk and liquidity risk. As such, it could provide a safe foundation for private-sector innovations to meet current and future needs and demands for payment services. It shall also help in levelling the playing field in payment innovation for firms of all sizes. For some smaller firms, the costs"

It might also generate new capabilities to meet the evolving speed and efficiency requirements of the digital economy. Furthermore, payments using CBDCs are final, thus reducing settlement risk in the financial system. CBDC will eliminate the need for interbank settlement by giving choices to market participants to choose among the various settlement options such as settlement in Central Bank / commercial bank accounts with / without using clearing corporations; or settlement on a bilateral basis without use of central counterparty by directly using CBDC accounts. It can be compared to a cash-based transaction, where instead of banknotes, CBDC is handed over leading to instant settlement. This is expected to bring in further efficiency in the payment system."

CBDCs can boost innovation in cross-border payments, making these transactions instantaneous and help overcome key challenges relating to time zone, exchange rate differences as well as legal and regulatory requirements across jurisdictions. Additionally, the interoperability of CBDCs presents means to mitigate cross -border and cross -currency risks and frictions while reinforcing the role of central bank money as an anchor for the payment system. Therefore, the potential use of CBDC in alleviating challenges in cross-border payment is one of the major motivations for exploring issuance of CBDC."

    "output": "Developing CBDC could provide the public a risk-free virtual currency that will provide them legitimate benefits without the risks of dealing in private virtual currencies. It may, therefore, fulfill demand for secured digital currency besides protecting the public from the abnormal level of volatility which some of these virtual digital assets experience. Thus, safeguarding the trust of the common man in the Indian Rupee vis-\u00e0-vis proliferation of crypto asset is another important motivation for introducing CBDC. The proliferation of crypto assets can pose significant risks related to Money Laundering & Financing of Terrorism. Further, the unabated use of crypto assets can be a threat to the monetary policy objectives as it may lead to creation of a parallel economy and will likely undermine the monetary policy transmission and stability of the domestic currency. It will also adversely affect the enforcement of foreign exchange regulations, especially, the circumvention of capital flow measures."

    "input": "Question: What are the design considerations for CBDC according to the BIS report and what are the two broad types of CBDC?",
    "output": "According to the October 2020 report by the BIS, in collaboration with several leading central banks, the core features and foundational principles of a CBDC were outlined. In formulating its foundational principles, BIS (2020) followed a risk-based approach, highlighting the need to identify all potential risks associated with issuing a CBDC, particularly those that threaten financial stability or negatively impact financial market structures. BIS outlined three important foundational principles for central banks to consider in issuing a CBDC: (i) It should not interfere with public policy objectives or prevent banks from performing their monetary stability mandate (a \u201cdo no harm\u201d principle). (ii) It should be used alongside and complement existing forms of money (the coexistence principle). (iii) It should promote innovation and competition to increase the overall efficiency and accessibility of the payment system (the innovation and efficiency principle).\n\nConsidering these principles, the design choices for issuing CBDCs are mainly driven by domestic circumstances, with no \u201cone size fits all\u201d approach. A well-functioning CBDC requires a resilient and secure infrastructure scalable to support a large user base. The design depends on the functions it is expected to perform, influencing payment systems, monetary policy, and financial system structure and stability. Given that designs and systems will differ by jurisdictions, so will the risk, requiring significant research by a central bank before implementation. A central bank should have robust means to mitigate any risks to financial stability before any CBDC is issued.\n\nBased on usage, functions, and accessibility, CBDC can be divided into two broad types: general purpose (retail) (CBDC-R) and wholesale (CBDC-W). CBDC-R is potentially available for use by all private sector, non-financial consumers and businesses. In contrast, wholesale CBDCs are designed for restricted access by financial institutions and could be used for improving the efficiency of interbank payments or securities settlement. Central banks interested in addressing financial inclusion are expected to consider issuing CBDC-R. Furthermore, CBDC\u2013W has the potential to transform the settlement systems for financial transactions undertaken by banks in the G-Sec Segment, Inter-bank market and capital market more efficient and secure in terms of operational costs, use of collateral and liquidity."

    "input": "Question: What are the potential benefits and use cases for wholesale (CBDC-W) and retail (CBDC-R) central bank digital currencies?",
    "output": "Wholesale CBDCs (CBDC-W) are intended for the settlement of interbank transfers and related wholesale transactions, serving the same purpose as reserves held at the central bank but with additional functionality, such as conditional payments. They could make central bank money programmable to support automation and mitigate risks and would be implemented on new technology stacks designed with international standards in mind to support interoperability. CBDC-W could also be explored for wholesale markets for asset classes which are OTC and bilaterally settled outside CCP arrangements, and to provide retail access for buying assets bypassing the bank account route. The adoption of CBDC-W will depend on upgrades to exchanges and trading infrastructure and its integration with RTGS, as well as whether the cost of CBDC-W settlement is less than existing settlement costs.\nRetail CBDCs (CBDC-R) are an electronic version of cash meant for retail consumption. The introduction of CBDC-R will provide a safe, central bank instrument with direct access to Central bank money for payment and settlement. It could also reinforce the resilience of a country\u2019s retail payment systems, providing an alternative medium of making digital payments in case of disruptions in other payment system infrastructures, and reduce the concentration of liquidity and credit risk in payment systems. Considering the different advantages of both, there may be merit in introducing both CBDC-W and CBDC-R."

    "output": "A key question in the design of a CBDC would be the respective roles of the central bank and the private sector in facilitating access to and use of a CBDC. There are three models for issuance and management of CBDCs across the globe. The key differences lie in the structure of legal claims and the record kept by the central bank. These models are:\nA) Single Tier model - Also known as \u201cDirect CBDC Model\u201d, this system involves the central bank managing all aspects, including issuance, account-keeping, and transaction verification. The central bank operates the retail ledger, making it central to all payments. CBDC represents a direct claim on the central bank, which keeps a record of all balances and updates it with every transaction. This provides a very resilient system, but marginalizes private sector involvement, hinders innovation, and may burden the central bank with customer on-boarding, KYC, and AML checks.\nB) Two-Tier Model (Intermediate model) - This model involves the central bank and other service providers, each playing their respective role. There are two models under the intermediate architecture viz. Indirect model and Hybrid Model.\nIndirect Model- In the \u201cindirect CBDC\u201d model, consumers would hold their CBDC in an account/ wallet with a bank, or service provider. The obligation to provide CBDC on demand would fall on the intermediary rather than the central bank. The central bank would track only the wholesale CBDC balances of the intermediaries. The central bank must ensure that the wholesale CBDC balances is identical with all the retail balances available with the retail customers.\nHybrid Model- In the Hybrid model, a direct claim on the central bank is combined with a private sector messaging layer."

    "input": "Question: How does the hybrid model for CBDC issuance and management work, and what are its advantages and disadvantages compared to other models?",
    "output": "In the Hybrid model, the central bank issues CBDC to other entities, making those entities responsible for customer-associated activities. Commercial intermediaries (payment service providers) provide retail services to end-users, but the central bank retains a ledger of retail transactions. This architecture operates on two engines: intermediaries handle retail payments, but the CBDC is a direct claim on the central bank, which also keeps a central ledger of all transactions and operates a backup technical infrastructure allowing it to restart the payment system if intermediaries run into insolvency or technical outages. Considering the merits of different models, the Indirect system may be the most suitable architecture for introduction of CBDC in India. As per the RBI Act, 1934, the Reserve Bank has the sole right to issue bank notes, which has now been amended to include currency in digital form also. Therefore, in this model, RBI will create and issue tokens to authorised entities called Token Service Providers (TSPs) who in turn will distribute these to end-users who take part in retail transactions."

    "input": "Question: What are the implications of remunerated vs. non-remunerated CBDCs?",
    "output": "The payment of interest on a CBDC would likely enhance its attractiveness as a store of value. Interest-bearing CBDCs could improve monetary policy effectiveness by directly influencing deposit rates. However, this could lead to financial system disintermediation due to loss of bank deposits, impeding credit creation. Banks might increase deposit rates, raising funding costs and decreasing Net Interest Income, potentially leading to riskier lending practices. Banks would also need more liquidity buffers. A cap on individual holdings could mitigate disintermediation but reduce CBDC attractiveness. Alternatively, if a CBDC is non-interest bearing, the public would have less incentive to switch from bank deposits, limiting banking disintermediation. The Bahamas and China currently do not pay interest on CBDC holdings to limit CBDC competing with bank deposits. While less attractive as a store of value, it can still be attractive as a medium of payment. Non-interest bearing CBDCs can avoid major disruption to banking services and disintermediation of banks. However, there is still a concern about the shifting of current accounts from corporates and business entities in favor of CBDC to gain access to central bank money. However, the current account is a relationship based and their association with banks is a function of multiple services offered to them and thus it is anticipated that scale of bank intermediation will be low for such deposits. In a nutshell, the economic design of a CBDC should be least disruptive to the existing financial system. Moreover, CBDCs are electronic form of sovereign currency and should imbibe all the possible features of currency. Since, physical cash does not carry any interest it would be logical to offer Non-Interest bearing CBDCs. Banks would restrain themselves from distributing CBDCs if they find it as a threat to their bank deposits which can"

    "output": "To begin with, many jurisdictions have opted to limit the holdings of CBDCs available to the public for transactional purposes (in wallets) to put a cap on the scale of disintermediation, as it is expected to be least disruptive. Furthermore, setting a conversion limit between deposits or cash to CBDC or paying no interest or lower interest rates on CBDC relative to bank deposits can avoid a major disruption to banking services and a possible disintermediation of banks, while dealing with the trade-off between improved interest rate transmission and a clogged credit market, and ensures that non-interest bearing CBDC will not hamper the existing transmission dynamics.

CBDC-R is mainly devised for consumption of the common public with features akin to physical cash, such as being anonymous and having a unique serial number. A token-based system would ensure universal access, offer good privacy by default, and enable the detection of counterfeiting. The token will have a unique number, potentially allowing for the restoration of value if an individual loses the device. Under a token-based CBDC-R regime, users can withdraw digital tokens from banks, maintain them in a wallet, and spend them online or in person or transfer them via an app. The token based CBDC also supports innovation with an ability to include programmable feature that supports efficiency such as standardisation of compliance rules, fraud detection, wrapped CBDC to other use cases in future.

    "output": "A token-based CBDC may be issued either with a minimum value or fixed denominations akin to existing physical currency denominations. The usage of minimum value of token may result in higher volume and, thus, lead to increase in processing time and performance issues. The physical appearance (touch and feel) of cash in India imparts trust to the public to undertake cash transactions. The introduction of CBDC with fixed Denomination as in physical currencies in denominations of Rs. 500, 100, 50 etc., shall facilitate in building the same level of trust and experience among public albeit in digital form. This similarity with existing currency is expected to induce wider acceptance and adoption of CBDC. Moreover, the fixed denomination CBDC shall facilitate transactions by way of exchange management of tokens in permissible legal tender of the country with help of TSPs . Therefore, introduction of fixed denomination CBDC is presently considered as preferable taking into account the Indian scenario."

    "input": "Question: What are the key requirements for implementing CBDC infrastructure and how do conventional and DLT-based infrastructures differ in data updates?",
    "output": "The key requirements for implementing CBDC infrastructure are:\na) Zero downtime, to keep the economy functioning\nb) Zero frauds, to prevent destabilization of the economy\nc) Decentralization, for effective participation of the ecosystem\nd) Need for confidentiality, authentication, data integrity, and non-repudiation\ne) High volume and rate of Transactions, will be a key requirement of the ecosystem partners to avoid choking of the CBDC platform resulting in delays in completing financial transactions\nf) Design for unpredictable workloads, the platform must handle both lean and peak load periods in a cost-effective manner.\ng) Zero loss due to Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) and other brute cyberattacks\nh) Mission Critical approach, to meet all the above key requirements\n\nThe infrastructure selected for implementing CBDC could be based on a conventional centrally controlled database, or on a distributed ledger. Conventional and Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)-based infrastructures often store data multiple times and in separate physical locations. However, the key difference between conventional and DLT based infrastructure lies in how data is updated. In conventional databases, resilience is ensured by storing data over multiple physical nodes, which are controlled by one authoritative central entity, i.e., the top node of the hierarchy. On the other hand, in DLT-based systems, the ledger is usually managed jointly by multiple entities in a decentralised manner and each update needs to be harmonised amongst the nodes of all entities without the requirement of a top node. This consensus mechanism requires additional overhead which is the primary reason why DLTs enables lower transactions than conventional architectures. Given the above, DLT at this point of time, is not considered suitable technology except in very small jurisdictions, given the probable low volume of data throughput. However, DLT could be considered for the indirect or hybrid CBDC architecture. Further, it may also be possible that some layers of the CBDC tech stack can be on centralized system and remaining on distributed networks. The choice of tech architecture shall also factor in the resource intensiveness and energy efficiency associated with the solutions."

    "output": "The entire lifecycle of CBDC should be within an end-to-end trusted environment by ensuring that double-spending and malicious token creation or manipulation is avoided, monitored, and checked regularly. It also needs to be confirmed that data is shared only with the relevant parties and does not need to be shared across the whole network (distributed or otherwise) for verification. Systemic checks through third-party validation should ensure that, in case of a token system, only tokens issued by the Central bank are circulating in the ecosystem. A competent party should be able to verify identity information before a participant is allowed to join the CBDC network.\n\nIn account-based models, recoverability isn't an issue since user identity is always available where the account is held. For token-based models, based on whether CBDCs will be recoverable or not, the system can support two types of wallets based on User Consent: Custodian Model, where a Token Service Provider (TSP) manages the keys, making the wallet recoverable but potentially compromising anonymity; and User Held Model, where the user is responsible for key holding, and the wallet is not recoverable if the device is lost.\n\nTo ensure widespread use of CBDC, offline capabilities need to be incorporated. While digital payments rely on online communications, there may be times when CBDC users will experience little or no access to network connectivity. Considering that a significant portion of the Indian population lacks internet access, offline functionality is crucial for widespread adoption."

    "output": "BoJ explored the potential use of PASMO/Suica cards, which are used for railway and transport ticket passes as well as electronic money. Visa has also proposed an Offline Payment System (OPS). The protocol outlined by Visa allows CBDCs to be directly downloaded onto a personal device, such as a smartphone or tablet. The money is stored on a secure hardware embedded in that device and managed by a wallet provider. The CBDC can be transacted from one device to another device directly without any intermediaries such as banks, payment networks, or payment processors using Bluetooth and Near Field Communication. However, Visa\u2019s solution does not account for double spending of tokens. In offline mode, the risk of \u201cdouble-spending\u201d will exist because it will be technically possible to use a CBDC unit more than once without updating the common ledger of CBDC, however, the same can be mitigated to a larger extent by technical solutions and appropriate business rules including monetary limit on offline transactions. The use of offline transactions would be beneficial in remote locations and offer availability and resilience benefits when electrical power or mobile network is not available. For offline transactions, the wallets must be able to independently verify the authenticity of any CBDC transaction without communicating with the server during the transactions. Even in the case of offline transactions, there would still be a periodic need for power and network connectivity to reload or redeem CBDC balances or to synchronize the local wallet balances with central servers. It is thus desirable that CBDC should have offline capabilities, without which it will not prove to be an attractive and accessible medium of payment for a wide category of users. It is essential to devise uniform standards and protocols for the offline exchange of CBDC. To make sure that these standards and protocols are robust and future ready, it is necessary to have extensive industry consultation. To ensure widespread use of CBDC, offline capabilities need to be incorporated, especially considering that in India, many people will not be able to use CBDCs due to connectivity unavailability. "

    "output": "An Indian CBDC should utilize the current payments infrastructure like UPI, digital wallets like Paytm, Gpay, etc. Interoperability between payment systems contributes to achieving adoption, co-existence, innovation, and efficiency for end users. It would be key to integrate a CBDC into the broader payments landscape of India, which would possibly help drive end-user adoption (both for the public and merchants). This will obviate the need for the creation of a parallel acceptance infrastructure. RBI would have options in how it plans to achieve interoperability, from the use of established messaging, data, and other technical standards to building technical interfaces to communicate with other systems. Integration between systems through APIs shall allow a light yet secure inter-operable architecture. It will be necessary to ensure the robustness of APIs as well for heightened cyber-security. Yet barriers to interoperability would likely exist, covering technical, commercial, and legal aspects, and dialogue with stakeholders would be key in addressing these. Achieving interoperability is a collaborative process and will require the active involvement of all industry players in the Indian payments landscape. When engaging in cross-border CBDC transactions, RBI will sometimes deal with different networks for each major currency transaction. Here, interoperability between networks will become important. Being able to conduct exchanges of assets in coordinated transactions across two different ledgers (centralized or decentralized), without requiring an intermediary, will help enhance efficiency and mitigate risk. An example of wholesale CBDC involving different currencies is the BIS innovation hub project involving the central banks of China, Hong Kong, United Arab Emirates, and Thailand collaborating on the Multiple Central Bank Digital Currency (m-CBDC) Bridge Project, which aims to develop an international settlement platform through which central banks can utilize CBDC for transactions by financial institutions.

In case of different jurisdictions functioning with two disparate technical architecture, inter-operability can be achieved through a common bridge that is able to standardize the inputs and outputs from different systems in a common form understandable to every stakeholder. Such a bridge shall also need to configure various country specific regulations related to access, and legislations relating to foreign exchange, respective jurisdictional boundaries, governance issues etc. Various control mechanisms would also need to be put to prevent any spillover effects in an inter-connected global world. It may, thus, be preferred if a jurisdiction works on developing the robust standards required to enable interoperability between CBDC with the existing or proposed payment systems. Collaboration with stakeholders including with BIS on developing common global standards for facilitating easy cross-border transactions, will be a way forward. CBDC ecosystems may be at similar risk for cyber-attacks as the current payment systems are exposed to. The cybersecurity considerations need to be taken care of both for the item and the environment. For example, while the token creation process should ensure the highest levels of the cryptography to ensure security at the item level, the transaction of tokens also needs to be secured to ensure trusted environment. Further, in countries with lower financial literacy levels, the increase in digital payment related frauds may also spread to CBDCs. Ensuring high standards of cybersecurity and parallel efforts on financial literacy is therefore essential for any country dealing with CBDC. It is also understood that the CBDC ecosystem would be a high value target owing to its significance for maintaining public trust. Much of the plans to address cyber risks would depend on the underlying technology. Public blockchains preserve transparency but that does not provide cyber security by itself. On the other hand, centralised systems will have the same cyber security concerns as is applicable to the existing Fast Payment Systems (FPS). While the plan to address cyber risks shall be very specific as per respective cases, certain principles that can be applied for CBDCs are: (i) Security has to be the prime design concern while designing CBDCs since inception. (ii) Users with privileged roles within the CBDC network should be made subject to an enhanced risk management framework. (iii) While the back -end infrastructure shall certainly be robust, the user interface should also be rigorously tested to prevent the exploitation of any vulnerabilities.

Further, to the maximum extent possible, the adverse impact on production systems and business processes should be minimised. The use of APIs (Application Program Interfaces) facilitate interaction with required currency management systems at central banks and token service providers.\nTherefore, in addition to technology solutions, security risks would also need to be mitigated through policy calls like putting caps, enhanced risk management and governance framework and rigorous testing of functionalities through pilot before rolling out the CBDCs for public."

In distributed systems, it depends on whether there is a consensus protocol, and if so, whether it's highly resource-intensive like \"Proof of Work.\" CBDCs are generally not \"mined\" like private cryptocurrencies, where individuals compete to mine and create the cryptocurrency. In the case of CBDC, the sovereign/central bank is competent and authorised to issue the CBDC and can opt for conversion of the bank\u2019s existing balances to CBDC balances. However, in token-based systems, unique tokens based on agreed techniques would need to be created, which may be slightly resource intensive.

The central bank must ensure that both the infrastructure and participants of a CBDC system should be extremely resistant to cyber-attacks and other threats, including ensuring effective protection from counterfeiting. To maintain public trust in the CBDC, the CBDC system should be scalable enough to meet public demand, intermediaries should be able to fulfill their obligations of meeting the demand and access to CBDC for initiating a transaction by the public should be seamless. The scope of CBDC related grievances such as deficiency in service by the intermediaries, technical disruption in supply of CBDC, and transaction issues may be covered under a robust and efficient grievance redressal mechanism.

The shift in currency form (from physical to digital) may alter public behavior in holding money, influencing the balance between currency and deposits, and between physical and digital forms. However, the precise nature of this change is currently uncertain as most central banks are still exploring CBDC issuance.\n\nIf CBDC is remunerated, it can have a much larger impact on reserve money, money supply, and net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) of banks because of the potential for substituting commercial bank deposits with CBDCs. This could constrain commercial banks' funds, making them more reliant on central bank liquidity provisions and bloating the central bank's balance sheet, which increases reserve money due to financial disintermediation. Non-remunerated CBDC can significantly minimize potential disruptions to monetary policy and the financial intermediation process. Interest-bearing CBDC, in turn, would require a comprehensive review of the operating framework of monetary policy, and even the monetary policy framework, as that would require a decision on the rate of interest to be paid on CBDC, and also to deal with the challenge of financial disintermediation.\n\nThe impact of CBDC on key monetary variables can be summarized as follows:\n\nImpact on Non-remunerated CBDCs:\n*   Reserve Money: Yes/No\n*   Money Supply: No\n*   Velocity: No\n*   Money Multiplier: Yes/No\n*   Liquidity Conditions/LAF: Yes/No\n*   Monetary Policy (Repo Rate): No\n\nImpact on Remunerated CBDCs:\n*   Reserve Money: Yes\n*   Money Supply: Yes\n*   Velocity: Yes\n*   Money Multiplier: Yes\n*   Liquidity Conditions/LAF: Yes\n*   Monetary Policy (Repo Rate): Yes"

    "input": "Question: What are some of the key considerations and potential implications regarding the financial stability and legal aspects of implementing a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC)?",
    "output": "In times of financial crisis, CBDC may hypothetically result in faster bank runs, and financial disintermediation could lead banks to rely on more expensive and less stable sources of funding. However, such scenarios can be addressed through appropriate limits on CBDC holdings and transactions. Central banks are exploring safeguards that could be built into any CBDC to address financial stability risks; although such measures may need careful consideration before they are used. Central banks might consider measures to influence or control CBDC adoption or use, including measures such as access criteria for permitted users, limits on individuals\u2019 CBDC holdings or transactions, and particular choices around CBDC remuneration. Many studies argue that CBDC is likely to weigh on bank profitability and lending. If banks respond to a CBDC by increasing reliance on market funding, then depending on the type of market funding banks\u2019 maturity transformation and their liquidity risk may face upward pressure because of more reliance on less stable funding sources, or some downward pressure if market discipline increases. The volatility of market-based funding may also increase the pro-cyclicality of bank lending. CBDC requires a legal framework that clarifies whether the central bank has the mandate to issue CBDC and what status it would have legally. Existing legal frameworks were typically enacted in a pre-digital age and investigating CBDC therefore also entails ascertaining whether law reform is necessary to ensure that a CBDC can be issued by the central bank. The legal considerations for issuing CBDC will mainly be dependent on the final operational and technological design features. Depending on the forms of issuance either as account or token based CBDCs, they shall carry different legal significance. The account based CBDCs which is like the existing account forms of money shall not be considered to be a new form of money, instead as the digital form of \u2018book money\u2019, which are credit balances on accounts. In contrast, token-based CBDCs are a new form of money where the central banks\u2019 liability is incorporated in the token. Most of the central banks derive their powers from their laws to issue a currency in the form of banknotes and coins, book money and bills. Some central banks even have broader remit to issue currency more generally, which could encompass CBDC. If the central banks decide to issue token based CBDCs, central banks shall need to have the power to issue currency in general rather than limiting their powers to only banknotes and coins. Similarly, if the central banks decide to issue the CBDCs in account form, legal amendments shall be required to allow central banks to open accounts for the public since currently the central banks are generally capable of opening bank accounts but with certain restrictions as to who can hold an account with the central banks. The issuance of CBDC in token- based form shall create a parallel payment system and if the payment system function of central banks is restricted to only interbank systems, the implications of the CBDC issuance on laws"

    "output": "Along with the central bank laws, the monetary law of the country also needs to be changed on the issues including the right of issuance of CBDC, legal tender status, and criminal law protection from counterfeits etc. However, there isn\u2019t much distinction between central bank and monetary law and the amendments in the legislation shall be replicated in the central bank law. Accordingly, in order to create and issue CBDC, we need to carefully consider the potential amendments of existing laws or the creation of laws before CBDC issuance. The introduction of CBDC in India by the Reserve Bank required enabling legal framework since the legal provisions were made keeping in mind currency in paper form. Under the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, the Bank is empowered to \u201c\u2026regulate the issue of bank notes and the keeping of reserves with a view to securing monetary stability in India and generally to operate the currency and credit system of the country to its advantage\u201d (Preamble). The Reserve Bank derives the necessary statutory powers from various sections of the RBI Act \u2013 with respect to denomination (Section 24), form of banknotes (Section 25), status as legal tender (Sec 26(1)) etc. The necessary amendments to the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 relating to enhancing the scope of the definition of \u2018bank note\u2019 to include currency in digital form and non-applicability of certain sections that are applicable to physical currencies alone and not relevant for digital currency , have since been passed by the Parliament."

    "output": "Central banks are expected to design CBDCs that conform to the AML/CFT requirements (along with any other regulatory expectations or disclosure laws). A CBDC payment system would need to be compliant with AML and CFT regulations and requirements. This means that the identity of CBDC users would need to be known to at least some authority or institution in the wider CBDC network who can validate the legitimacy of their transaction. AML responsibilities could be handled entirely by the Payment Interface Providers (commercial banks). Under the intermediate model, commercial banks may be best placed to conduct AML/CFT checks and the responsibility for compliance with AML/CFT guidelines should rest with them. Opening and maintenance of CBDC accounts with commercial banks would not require any change in the current AML/ CFT guidelines unless there is a new Financial Action Task Force (FATF) recommendation specifically for CBDCs. This arrangement means that the Bank would not hold granular personal data on any user, reducing the privacy concerns that could arise in connection with holding personal user data, but AML requirements could still be met by the CBDC system as a whole. From the perspective of AML/CFT, the CBDC framework should address the following two aspects: i. It needs to be ensured that the ultimate responsibility for Customer Due Diligence (CDD) is clearly delineated in the framework. ii. The design of the CBDC should have the embedded mechanism for identifying and monitoring the transactions, as per the threshold limit as applicable in case of cash, to maintain the financial sector integrity."

    "output": "As more central banks begin researching the possibilities of issuing a CBDC, there is a common concern around the impact this will have on privacy and should be considered carefully when designing CBDC. Awareness regarding privacy and data protection issue is increasing, accordingly stronger data protection regulation is being introduced in different jurisdictions. In December 2019, India's Ministry of Electronics, and Information Technology tabled the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 (the PDP) in the Lok Sabha. The Bill sought to provide for protection of personal data of individuals and proposed to establish a Data Protection Authority. However, the PDP Bill has now been withdrawn and the government is expected to bring in a new legislation with comprehensive legal framework for the digital economy.\n\nWhile issuing CBDC, the central bank collects range of customer related data and, it is, therefore, essential to have defined privacy principle and data subjects rights. India presently do not have data protection law, however, in August 2017, the Supreme Court held that privacy is a fundamental right, flowing from the right to life and personal liberty under Article 21 of the Constitution. The Court also observed that privacy of personal data and facts is an essential aspect of the right to privacy. It is therefore imperative that while collecting data for issuance of CBDC, best interest of the citizens should be prioritised, only those personal identifiable data may be collected which is necessary and use these data only for the purpose for which it is collected.\n\nA Central Bank while considering the security aspect of the CBDC may be guided by some of the most-used risk and security frameworks, guidance, and standards. RBI may refer to CPMI -IOSCO Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures particularly, Principle 2 on Governance and Principle 17 on Operational Risk which set standards that are particularly relevant for managing operational risk, including information security risk . The description of Principles is discussed below:\nPrinciple 2: Governance - An FMI should have governance arrangements that are clear and transparent, promote the safety and efficiency of the FMI, and support the stability of the broader financial system, other relevant public interest considerations, and the objectives of relevant stakeholders.\nPrinciple 17: Operational Risk - An FMI should identify the plausible sources of operational risk, both internal and external, and mitigate their impact through the use of appropriate systems, policies, procedures, and controls. Systems should be designed to ensure a high degree of security"

As per recommendations of the internal Working Group (WG) set up by Reserve Bank in October 2020, RBI is exploring the option of implementation of account-based CBDC in Wholesale segment and token-based CBDC in Retail segment vide a graded approach. This phase involves the following steps: i. Build a prototype as per the recommendations of the WG. Specify technical requirements to technology partners. ii. Test the idea in an operationally controlled environment to examine its functionality, including the design, deployment plan and success criteria. iii. Perform test cases with both positive and negative scenarios to examine its durability and document the results. iv. Evaluate Test Results and finalise the design of the prototype v. Pilot: Conducting large scale pilots with a diverse and larger user base. Participants of the pilots must include users from different income levels, literacy levels, regions, genders and age groups. This will help RBI understand the potential use of the CBDC in a diverse country like India. The results and learnings of the pilot need to be carefully evaluated and must be incorporated into the final design of the CBDC."

Central banks' accommodative monetary policy during the pandemic led to balance sheet expansion and risks, followed by aggressive tightening due to inflation, resulting in negative net interest income for many. Despite these challenges, the Bank\u2019s prudent Accounting Policies and the ECF have enabled RBI to augment its financial resilience and ensure healthy surplus transfer to the Government.

The extant ECF of RBI is guided by the principle that the alignment of the objectives of the Government and the RBI is important. As the central bank is a part of the Sovereign, ensuring the credibility of the RBI is as important, if not more, to the Government, as it is to the RBI itself. The ECF also recognises the fact that being a public policy institution, RBI\u2019s focus is on ensuring efficacy of its policy actions, even if such actions entail assuming significant balance sheet risks. Being the primary bulwark for monetary, financial and external stability, RBI\u2019s financial resilience must be commensurate with the statutory responsibilities enshrined upon it, to ensure that RBI is seen as having the financial wherewithal to carry out loss-making policy actions, thereby ensuring their credibility."

It also recognizes that ineffective risk management can adversely impact RBI\u2019s core objectives. The ECF stipulates prudent economic capital levels for market risk, credit risk, operational risk, and monetary and financial stability risk, assessed as follows:\n(i) Market risk: Economic capital is assessed using Expected Shortfall (ES) under stressed conditions, targeting resilience at a 99.5 per cent confidence level (CL) and a lower tolerance threshold (risk tolerance limit, RTL) of 97.5 per cent CL.\n(ii) Monetary and financial stability risks: Provisioning is based on scenario analysis, stipulated between 4.5 per cent and 5.5 per cent of the B/S size.\n(iii) Credit and operational risk: Provisioning is maintained at an implicit level of 1 per cent of the B/S size.\nEconomic capital under the ECF comprises Realized Equity and Revaluation Balances.

Central banks adopted accommodative monetary policies as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to an inordinate expansion in their balance sheets (with concomitant increase in balance sheet risks), followed by aggressive and rapid monetary tightening in the face of persistent inflation. Many central banks reported losses on an unprecedented scale, primarily on account of the twin-fold materialisation of interest rate risk. Advanced economy central banks resorted to large- scale asset purchases as a part of quantitative and qualitative easing to maintain adequate liquidity in the financial system and support transmission of monetary policy. The purchase of these long-term fixed coupon assets was funded by creation of short-term reserves, resulting in an asset liability maturity mismatch, prone to repricing risk."

    "output": "In recent years, many central banks have reported losses on an unprecedented scale, primarily due to the twin-fold materialization of interest rate risk. First, advanced economy central banks resorted to large-scale asset purchases as part of quantitative and qualitative easing to maintain liquidity and support monetary policy transmission. These long-term fixed coupon assets were funded by short-term reserves, creating an asset liability maturity mismatch prone to repricing risk. As short-term interest rates rose rapidly due to subsequent monetary tightening to rein in inflation, the increase in interest expense contracted the net interest margin, resulting in a negative net interest income. Second, central banks with fair value accounting also suffered valuation losses on their portfolio of domestic and foreign securities as interest rates rose. The impact of these valuation losses was more pronounced in central banks following IFRS 9 accounting standards, where valuation gains/losses are taken to the P&L instead of being recorded in the balance sheet like at the RBI."

    "input": "Question: According to literature, what are the arguments for and against central banks maintaining adequate capital, and what factors contribute to financial independence for a central bank?",
    "output": "The literature presents varied views on the role of a central bank's capital. Arguments against adequate capital center on the ability of central banks to perform domestic operations regardless of net worth, as they can issue liabilities, and the fact that the broader government balance sheet matters. Some argue that a central bank\u2019s financial strength does not necessarily link with inflation or its ability to act as a Lender of Last Resort (LOLR) and Market Maker of Last Resort (MMLR). However, limitations exist, such as the inflationary impact of printing money, policy choice constraints, adverse market perception of policy independence, and strain on public finances in the event of recapitalization. An overwhelming amount of literature supports central banks with a sound capital base, as financial strength supports independence and credibility, signaling readiness to act swiftly in response to crises. Moreover, central banks that regulate commercial bank capital requirements are better positioned if financially sound.\nFinancial independence, including the availability of a Reserve Fund, the ability to control distributions to the Government and exclude unrealized gains from net profit, has been assessed as the most critical metric for central bank autonomy. Central banks of advanced economies recognize the need for maintaining optimal capital and provisions \u2018to maintain resilience, to absorb unexpected losses, to adapt to evolving risks, and to effectively fulfil mandates, even in challenging economic conditions\u2019 as well as to maintain \u2018public trust in central bank independence\u2019 , while noting that capital adequacy should take \u2018jurisdiction-specific circumstances into account, as central banks have diverse mandates, operations and sizes\u2019, an approach that is recognised by the ECF as well."

    "output": "As a result of the liquidity extended by RBI, an increase in CGRA due to rising foreign exchange reserves (from robust capital inflows and cross-currency movements), and rupee depreciation, the RBI\u2019s balance sheet expanded by 30.02% in FY 2019-20 and at a Compounded Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 20.76% during the period June 30, 2019 to March 31, 2021. This expansion rate was higher than the previous 10 years (CAGR of 11.29%) and the Expert Committee's projection in 2018-19, leading to increased realized risk provisioning from net income. Furthermore, the subsequent hardening of yields in foreign and domestic securities between 2021 and 2023 caused a decline in IRA balances of almost \u20b93.32 lakh crore (equivalent to 5.24% of the balance sheet as of March 31, 2023). During this period, exchange rate risk materialized, with a decrease in CGRA partly due to rupee appreciation against the EUR and GBP."

Specifically:\n(i) Net valuation (unrealised) gains/losses are recorded under Revaluation Accounts in the balance sheet and not included in the Income Statement, ensuring that the net income of RBI is not subject to volatile swings.\n(ii) Net unrealized losses in Revaluation Accounts are charged to Contingency Fund (CF) on the date of finalisation of Annual Accounts, ensuring that these losses are fully provided for.\n(iii) Net income is first used for risk provisioning to augment Realized Equity to the resilience level decided by the Central Board, with only the residual net income being transferred to the Government. This has ensured that RBI\u2019s economic capital has remained robust and its balance sheet resilient to risks."

RBI's balance sheet emerged stronger from these episodes, sustaining and enhancing surplus transfer to the Government. It was therefore deemed judicious to continue with the economic capital framework recommended by the Expert Committee (Chair: Dr. Bimal Jalan) and adopted by the RBI in the preceding five years.\n\nSince the methodologies for market, credit, and operational risks are based on global standards, the review proposes no major changes in risk assessment methodologies and underlying assumptions, as recommended by the Expert Committee after evaluating available risk methodologies and their appropriateness for RBI.\n\nThe review highlighted two areas where the framework could be further bolstered to ensure continued alignment with its core objective: (i) The transfer of surplus to the Government has not been as stable as was desirable, as explained in para 4.25."

    "output": "The internal review of the Economic Capital Framework of the Reserve Bank of India recommended the following: the Central Board should have more flexibility to smoothen the transfer of surplus over the years, and risk sources, such as market risk on off-balance sheet exposures, that were not significant previously should now be included in the framework. Realized Equity and Revaluation Balances may continue to be the twin components of RBI\u2019s economic capital, with the extant principle of one-way fungibility (implying that revaluation balances cannot provide for risks other than market risk, while realized equity can provide for all risks, including market risk) continuing to be applicable. An analysis of the methodologies used to assess and quantify market risks brings out the fact that Expected Shortfall (ES) continues to be the gold standard. As such, it is proposed that the assessment of market risk buffer requirement for on-balance sheet items may continue to be carried out using a parametric distribution of returns and applying the Expected Shortfall model under stressed conditions.  It is proposed that an integrated approach may be adopted, wherein the OFBS portfolio is also considered, together with the on-B/S portfolio, while computing the market risk buffer requirement.  A simulation exercise was carried out to determine the most stressful period for computation of variance."

The period ended August 2013 continues to be the most appropriate for computation of stress variance-covariance matrix. However, the variance covariance matrix of price returns may, henceforth, be computed directly from price returns, instead of the existing process of approximating it by transforming the variance-covariance matrix of yield returns using pre- and post-multiplicative factors. Finally, going forward, the requirement of market risk buffers may also consider the deployment of Foreign Currency Assets in minor currencies."

It shows various scenarios (A through H) with different combinations of domestic yield jumps, foreign yield jumps, cross-currency depreciation with respect to USD, and INR appreciation with respect to USD. Each scenario lists the Expected Mark-to-Market (MTM) loss, the Residual balance with respect to Expected Shortfall (ES) at 99.5% confidence level (CL), and the Residual balance with respect to ES at 97.5% CL. For example, Scenario A assumes shocks similar to those assumed by the extant ECF and shows that market risk buffers equivalent to ES (stress) 99.5 per cent CL leave a residual buffer of 3.69 per cent of BS size for covering the excluded risks, while market risk buffers equivalent to ES (stress) 97.5 per cent CL are only adequate to meet the assumed shocks.

    "output": "Revaluation balances in excess of their requirement, if any, shall, by virtue of being unrealized gains, continue to be on the Balance Sheet (B/S) for meeting market risks and will not be available for distribution. The impact of the proposals on the requirement of risk buffers for market risk over the last five years is detailed in Annex IV. The assessment of economic capital requirement for credit risk (including on account of OFBS exposures) and operational risk may continue to be carried out as hitherto. The requirement for economic capital, assessed as above, has remained around one per cent of the B/S size. Accordingly, the implicit combined requirement of realized equity for credit risk and operational risk at one per cent of B/S size may continue to be maintained, in line with the extant framework. The ECF recognizes financial stability risks as the rarest of rare fat tail risks, the occurrence of which can potentially devastate the economy, and the concomitant responsibility on central banks, including RBI, to safeguard financial system stability. This may include measures such as providing emergency liquidity assistance, even by diluting collateral standards , and undertaking asset purchases , including private ones, to address market dysfunction and support monetary policy objectives, even if it entails assuming significant credit risk. In recognition of the fact that RBI forms the primary bulwark for monetary and financial stability, the Expert Committee had recommended that the size of the monetary and financial stability risk provisions be maintained between 4.5 to 5.5 per cent of the balance sheet size, to ensure the availability of adequate financial resources to assuage market participants\u2019 concerns in case of a systemic stability crisis, and for the RBI\u2019s crisis mitigating measures to be seen as credible."

Although ELA provided by RBI is expected to be collateralized, extending it to SCBs beyond their stock of High-Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) exposes RBI to both market and credit risk. These provisions are maintained as the country\u2019s savings for a rainy day, in view of RBI\u2019s role as the Lender of Last Resort (LOLR).

    "output": "Regarding other sources of contingent financial stability risks, the interconnectedness between banks and non-bank financial entities in the financial system is seen to be increasing, thereby increasing the risk of a contagion in a financial crisis. Further, given the global operations of SCBs, the possibility of RBI having to provide liquidity in foreign currency to overseas branches of SCBs in periods of stress, with tightening of counterparty credit lines and widening of spreads, may not be ruled out.\n\nHowever, it is pertinent to also highlight the resilience demonstrated by the Bank in the face of the extreme macroeconomic factors, as elaborated in Chapter 2 of the report. This resilience of the Bank is of importance in the broader context of monetary and financial stability, especially when numerous other central banks have incurred losses and have depleted their equity in the preceding five years in their efforts to maintain monetary and financial stability. The resilience of the Bank\u2019s Balance Sheet, assessed in terms of economic capital, risk provisions and surplus transfer to the Government, is elaborated in Chapter 3 of the report.\n\nThe resilience is also significant as it persisted despite the Bank undertaking several targeted measures during the pandemic to support the financial system and stabilise the broader economy. While these measures had the potential to impact the Balance Sheet, the Bank did not experience any such adverse outcomes. This indicates the strength and resilience of the Balance Sheet of the Bank, even during macroeconomic volatility and systemic stress.\n\nIn recent years, the foreign exchange reserves of the Bank have increased significantly from USD 433.71 billion as at end-September 2019 to USD 665.40 billion as at end-March 2025. The accretion has enhanced the Bank\u2019s capacity to manage external shocks, mitigate exchange rate volatility, and thereby support monetary and financial stability, besides improving the resilience of its balance sheet.\n\nBesides the resilience of the central bank, the banking sector has also exhibited a sharp improvement in the asset quality , indicating more resilient balance sheets and a lower risk of financial instability. The latest Financial Stability Report also reaffirms the resilience of the balance sheet of banks, by highlighting that the gross non-performing assets (GNPA) ratio of SCBs fell to a multi -year low of 2.6 per cent."

    "input": "Question: What are the surplus distribution policies of the Bank of England, Reserve Bank of Australia, and Reserve Bank of New Zealand?",
    "output": "The surplus distribution policies of select central banks are as follows:\n\nBank of England: The framework for the bank\u2019s capital is in terms of the MoU between BoE and HM Treasury. The metric to which the capital framework applies is the loss-absorbing capital (LAC) of the Bank. The LAC is the Bank\u2019s total capital less any capital components that cannot absorb losses. The parameters of the capital framework include a target, a floor, and a ceiling.\n\u2022\tIn case the LAC for the following period exceeds the target but below the ceiling, 50% of net profits is paid as the dividend to the Treasury.\n\u2022\tIf the metric exceeds the ceiling, 100% of net profits is paid as dividend to the Treasury.\n\u2022\tIf the metric is below the floor, the Bank receives a capital injection from the Treasury to return to target.\n\nReserve Bank of Australia: Net profit is dealt with statutorily in the following manner:\n\u2022\tUnrealised gains (or losses) are not available for distribution and are transferred to (absorbed by) the unrealised profits reserve. The remainder of net profit after this transfer is available for distribution.\n\u2022\tThe Ministry determines, after consulting the Bank Board, any amounts to be placed from distributable earnings to the credit of the Reserve Bank Reserve Fund (RBRF), the Bank's general reserve and to be set aside for contingencies. \n\u2022\tThe remainder of distributable earnings is payable as a dividend to the Commonwealth. The capital and statutory reserves are separate from the unrealised profit reserve.\n\nReserve Bank of New Zealand: In terms of the Act, the Bank must determine the amount it recommends to the Government in accordance with the principles set out in the Act."

    "output": "The surplus transfer policy for select central banks are as follows:\n\nReserve Bank of New Zealand: In terms of the Act, the Bank must determine the amount it recommends to the Government in accordance with the principles set out in the statement of financial risk management. The statement, brought out annually, sets out the minimum level of capital (Target Capital Level or \u2018TCL\u2019) that is deemed sufficient to cover potential financial risks. Financial loss modelling is completed on the most significant risks, and risk limits are set to ensure the Bank\u2019s balance sheet remains resilient under severe but plausible stressed market conditions (based on historical experience).\n\nBank of Canada: In terms of the Act, the surplus available from the operations of the Bank during each financial year is to be determined in the following manner: If the Bank\u2019s reserve fund is less than the paid-up capital, one third of the surplus is to be allocated to the reserve fund and the remainder is to be paid to the Government. If the reserve fund is not less than the paid-up capital, one fifth of the surplus is to be allocated to the reserve fund until the reserve fund reaches an amount five times the paid-up capital and the remainder is to be paid to the Government. If the reserve fund is not less than five times the paid-up capital, the whole of the surplus is to be paid to the Government. The Act also provides for the creation of a special reserve fund, wherein funds are allocated from the surplus, to offset unrealized valuation losses due to changes in the fair value of the investment portfolio of the Bank.\n\nSwiss National Bank (SNB): In terms of the Act, SNB is required to set up provisions permitting it to maintain the currency reserves at a level necessary for monetary policy. The remaining earnings are deemed to be distributable profit. Currently, the minimum annual allocation of percentage of profit to provisions is at 10%."

    "output": "The surplus transfer policies of the specified central banks are as follows:\n\nBank of Thailand (BoT): According to the Act, 25% of net profits are retained as reserves. The Act has also provided for other specific reserves to be retained, subject to approval. Unrealized gains or losses from revaluation of assets and liabilities of the BOT at the end of the period are presented in the Assets and Liabilities Revaluation Reserve under the equity section.\n\nBank Negara Malaysia: According to the Act, the surplus is to be transferred, subject to the following conditions: If the General Reserve Fund is less than the capital of the Bank, the whole of the net profit shall be credited to the General Reserve Fund. In the case of any year at the end of which the General Reserve Fund is not less than the capital of the Bank, but less than twice the capital of the Bank, not less than thirty percentum of the net profit shall be credited to the General Reserve Fund. Any net profit not retained as reserves is to be transferred to the Government. The income in the P&L statement includes only the realised capital gains or losses. The unrealised gains/ losses are part of the risk reserve and are not part of the general reserve.\n\nBank of Korea: According to the Act, the Bank is permitted to transfer 30% of the net profits earned for the year to its reserve. Additional net profit may be retained for transferring to a special reserve, on approval from Government. The remaining amount is to be transferred to the Government.\n\nPhilippines (Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas): Currently, 50% of the Central Bank\u2019s net profits are distributed to the Government as dividends. Unrealized gains or losses are recognized in the revaluation reserve account and are not accounted for in the P&L statement."

    "input": "Question: What is the rationale for computing the variance-covariance matrix from price returns and the impact of methodology changes on the economic capital requirement for market risk?",
    "output": "The existing MATLAB based market risk engine approximates the variance-covariance matrix of price returns of specified maturity buckets in various currencies by transforming the variance-covariance matrix of yield returns using pre and post multiplicative factors while computing parametric VaR/ES. The variance-covariance matrix of price returns is required in order to compute the portfolio\u2019s variance and consequently the VaR/ES at a specified CL. The pre and post multiplicative factor is a diagonal matrix arrived at as the product of modified duration and yield (on the reference date) for the corresponding currency and maturity bucket.\n\nWhile the above approximation is not otherwise seen to have a significant impact, an episode in 2021-2022 where EUR zero-coupon yields were close to zero and transitioning from negative to positive, resulted in an unusually high value of computed variance on account of high values of yield returns (as the denominator was close to zero), which was not being offset in the pre and post multiplicative factors, which considers a constant value of yield (prevailing on the reference date).\n\nThe aforesaid issue, essentially arising from the usage of running yields in the variance-covariance matrix of yield returns compared to the constant yield in pre and post multiplicative matrices, may be overcome if the variance-covariance matrix of price returns is computed directly by deriving the price of zero-coupon bonds from zero coupon yields using continuous compounding.\n\nThough the aforesaid issue did not have an impact on the requirement of market risk buffers computed during the review period, as the reference date (stress period) under the approved ECF is August 30, 2013, adoption of the proposed method (of computing variance-covariance matrix directly) would be statistically consistent and ensure that no undue anomaly is observed in the assessment of market risk should the reference period change from August 2013 to 2022 and beyond. This is also followed for the management of foreign exchange reserves by the Bank."

    "input": "Question: What is the background and objectives of the Regulatory Sandbox (RS) according to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)?",
    "output": "The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) set up an inter-regulatory Working Group (WG) in July 2016 to look into and report on the granular aspects of FinTech and its implications so as to review the regulatory framework and respond to the dynamics of the rapidly evolving FinTech scenario. The report of the WG was released on February 08, 2018, for public comments. One of the key recommendations of the WG was to introduce an appropriate framework for a Regulatory Sandbox (RS) within a well-defined space and duration where the financial sector regulator will provide the requisite regulatory guidance, so as to increase efficiency, manage risks and create new opportunities for consumers.\n\nThe Regulatory Sandbox (RS) usually refers to live testing of new products or services in a controlled/ test regulatory environment for which regulators may (or may not) permit certain regulatory relaxations for the limited purpose of the testing. The RS allows the regulator, the innovators, the financial service providers (as potential deployers of the technology) and the customers (as final users) to conduct field tests to collect evidence on the benefits and risks of new financial innovations, while carefully monitoring and containing their risks. It can provide a structured avenue for the regulator to engage with the ecosystem and to develop innovation- enabling or innovation- responsive regulations that facilitate delivery of relevant, low-cost financial products. The RS is an important tool which enables more dynamic, evidence-based regulatory environments which learn from, and evolve with, emerging technologies.\n\nThe objective of the RS is to foster responsible innovation in financial services, promote efficiency and bring benefit to consumers. The RS is, at its core, a formal regulatory programme for market participants to test new products, services or business models with customers in a live environment, subject to certain safeguards and oversight. The proposed financial service to be launched under the RS should include new or emerging technology, or use of existing technology in an innovative way and should address a problem and bring benefits to consumers."

    "instruction": "Answer the question based on the provided context from the financial report.",
    "input": "Question: What are the benefits of setting up a Regulatory Sandbox (RS)?",
    "output": "The setting up of a Regulatory Sandbox (RS) can bring several benefits:\n\nFirst and foremost, the RS fosters \u2018learning by doing\u2019 on all sides. Regulators obtain first-hand empirical evidence on the benefits and risks of emerging technologies and their implications, enabling them to take a considered view on the regulatory changes or new regulations that may be needed to support useful innovation, while containing the attendant risks. Incumbent financial service providers, including banks, also improve their understanding of how new financial technologies might work, which helps them to appropriately integrate such new technologies with their business plans. Innovators and FinTech companies can improve their understanding of regulations that govern their offerings and shape their products accordingly. Finally, feedback from customers, as end users, educates both the regulator and the innovator as to what costs and benefits might accrue to customers from these innovations.\n\nSecond, users of an RS can test the product\u2019s viability without the need for a larger and more expensive roll-out, if the product appears to have the potential to be successful. If any concerns arise, during the sandbox period, appropriate modifications can be made before the product is launched in the broader market.\n\nThird, FinTechs provide solutions that can further financial inclusion in a significant way. The RS can go a long way in not only improving the pace of innovation and technology absorption but also in financial inclusion and in improving financial reach. Areas that can potentially get a thrust from the RS include microfinance, innovative small savings, remittances, mobile banking and other digital payments.\n\nFourth, by providing a structured and institutionalized environment for evidence-based regulatory decision-making, the dependence of the regulator on industry/stakeholder consultations only is correspondingly reduced.\n\nFifth, the RS could lead to better outcomes for consumers through an increased range of products and services, reduced costs and improved access to financial services."

    "input": "Question: What are some of the risks and limitations associated with a Regulatory Sandbox, and how are they addressed?",
    "output": "Some of the risks and limitations associated with a Regulatory Sandbox are as follows: Case-by-case bespoke authorizations and regulatory relaxations can involve time and discretional judgements, which may be addressed by handling applications in a transparent manner and following well-defined principles in decision-making. The RBI or its RS cannot provide any legal waivers. Post-sandbox testing, a successful experimenter may still require regulatory approvals before the product/services/ technology can be permitted for wider application. There is potential for some legal issues coming up, such as those relating to consumer losses in case of failed experimentation. Such instances may not have much legal ground if the RS framework and processes are transparent and have clear entry and exit criteria. Upfront clarity that liability for customer or business risks shall devolve on the entity entering the RS will be important in this context."

Innovative technologies that could be considered include mobile technology applications (payments, digital identity, etc.), data analytics, application program interface (APIs) services, applications under blockchain technologies, and artificial intelligence and machine learning applications.\n\nThe RBI may consider relaxing some regulatory requirements for applicants during the RS on a case-to-case basis. Examples of regulatory relaxations that may be granted include liquidity requirements, board composition, management experience, financial soundness, and track record. However, requirements that must be complied with include customer privacy and data protection, secure storage of and access to payment data of stakeholders, security of transactions, KYC/AML/CFT requirements, and statutory restrictions."

At the end of the sandbox period, the regulatory relaxations provided to the entities will expire and the sandbox entity must exit the RS. If the sandbox entity requires an extension of the sandbox period, it should apply to the RBI at least one month before the expiration thereof and with valid reasons to support the application for extension. The RBI shall take an informed decision to allow extension or otherwise based on the stage of the testing, the results of the testing till then, justification for its continuance and the expected outcome in the extended period. The sandbox testing will be discontinued any time at the discretion of the RBI: (i) if the sandbox entity does not achieve its intended purpose, based on the latest test scenarios, expected outcomes and schedule mutually agreed by the sandbox entity with the RBI, (ii) if the sandbox entity is unable to fully comply with the relevant regulatory requirements and other conditions specified at any stage during the sandbox process, or (iii) if the sandbox entity has not acted in the best interest of consumers due to negligence or deliberate malicious practices. The sandbox entity may also exit from the RS at its own discretion by informing the RBI one month in advance. The sandbox entity shall ensure that any existing obligation to its customers of the financial service under experimentation is fully addressed before exiting the RS or discontinuing the RS. When the RS operates in the production environment, it must have a well-defined space and duration for the proposed financial service to be launched, within which the consequences of failure can be contained.

    "input": "Question: What is the background and objectives of the Regulatory Sandbox (RS)?",
    "output": "The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) set up an inter-regulatory Working Group (WG) in July 2016 to look into and report on the granular aspects of FinTech and its implications so as to review the regulatory framework and respond to the dynamics of the rapidly evolving FinTech scenario. The report of the WG was released on February 08, 2018, for public comments. One of the key recommendations of the WG was to introduce an appropriate framework for a Regulatory Sandbox (RS) within a well-defined space and duration where the financial sector regulator will provide the requisite regulatory guidance, so as to increase efficiency, manage risks and create new opportunities for consumers.\nAccordingly, a comprehensive framework highlighting the clear principles and role of the proposed RS including the reasons for setting up the RS and the expectations of the RBI, are detailed hereunder. The Regulatory Sandbox (RS) usually refers to live testing of new products or services in a controlled/ test regulatory environment for which regulators may (or may not) permit certain regulatory relaxations for the limited purpose of the testing. The RS allows the regulator, the innovators, the financial service providers (as potential deployers of the technology) and the customers (as final users) to conduct field tests to collect evidence on the benefits and risks of new financial innovations, while carefully monitoring and containing their risks. It can provide a structured avenue for the regulator to engage with the ecosystem and to develop innovation- enabling or innovation- responsive regulations that facilitate delivery of relevant, low-cost financial products. The RS is an important tool which enables more dynamic, evidence-based regulatory environments which learn from, and evolve with, emerging technologies.\nThe objective of the RS is to foster responsible innovation in financial services, promote efficiency and bring benefit to consumers. The RS is, at its core, a formal regulatory programme for market participants to test new products, services or business models with customers in a live environment, subject to certain safeguards and oversight. The proposed financial service to be launched under the RS should include new or emerging technology, or use of existing technology in an innovative way and should address a problem and bring benefits to consumers."

    "instruction": "Answer the question based on the provided context from the financial report.",
    "input": "Question: What are the benefits of setting up a Regulatory Sandbox (RS)?",
    "output": "The setting up of an RS can bring several benefits, some of which are significant. First and foremost, the RS fosters \u2018learning by doing\u2019 on all sides. Regulators obtain first-hand empirical evidence on the benefits and risks of emerging technologies and their implications, enabling them to take a considered view on the regulatory changes or new regulations that may be needed to support useful innovation, while containing the attendant risks. Incumbent financial service providers, including banks, also improve their understanding of how new financial technologies might work, which helps them to appropriately integrate such new technologies with their business plans. Innovators and FinTech companies can improve their understanding of regulations that govern their offerings and shape their products accordingly. Finally, feedback from customers, as end users, educates both the regulator and the innovator as to what costs and benefits might accrue to customers from these innovations.\nSecond, users of an RS can test the product\u2019s viability without the need for a larger and more expensive roll-out, if the product appears to have the potential to be successful. If any concerns arise, during the sandbox period, appropriate modifications can be made before the product is launched in the broader market.\nThird, FinTechs provide solutions that can further financial inclusion in a significant way. The RS can go a long way in not only improving the pace of innovation and technology absorption but also in financial inclusion and in improving financial reach. Areas that can potentially get a thrust from the RS include microfinance, innovative small savings, remittances, mobile banking and other digital payments.\nFourth, by providing a structured and institutionalized environment for evidence-based regulatory decision-making, the dependence of the regulator on industry/stakeholder consultations only is correspondingly reduced.\nFifth, the RS could lead to better outcomes for consumers through an increased range of products and services, reduced costs and improved access to financial services."

    "output": "The Regulatory Sandbox (RS) has several risks and limitations:\n\n4.  2 Case-by-case bespoke authorizations and regulatory relaxations can involve time and discretional judgements. This risk may be addressed by handling applications in a transparent manner and following well-defined principles in decision-making.\n5.  3 The RBI or its RS cannot provide any legal waivers.\n6.  4 Post-sandbox testing, a successful experimenter may still require regulatory approvals before the product/services/ technology can be permitted for wider application.\n7.  5 There is potential for some legal issues coming up, such as those relating to consumer losses in case of failed experimentation. Such instances may not have much legal ground if the RS framework and processes are transparent and have clear entry and exit criteria. Upfront clarity that liability for customer or business risks shall devolve on the entity entering the RS will be important in this context.\n\nThe target applicants for entry to the RS are FinTech companies including start-ups, banks, financial institutions, any other company, Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) and partnership firms, partnering with or providing support to financial services businesses, subject to the sandbox criteria laid down in these guidelines. The focus of the RS will be to encourage innovations intended for use in the Indian market in areas where:\ni. there is absence of governing regulations;\nii. there is a need to temporarily ease regulations for enabling the proposed innovation;\niii. the proposed innovation shows promise of easing/effecting delivery of financial services in a significant way.\n\nThe RBI shall consider key design features for the RS, including running a few cohorts (end-to-end sandbox process) with a limited number of entities in each cohort testing their products during a stipulated period. The RS shall be based on thematic cohorts focusing on financial inclusion, payments and lending, digital KYC, etc. The cohorts may run for varying time periods but should ordinarily be completed within seven months. In order to ensure continuous innovation in the closed themes, the RS may also accept \u2018On Tap\u2019 Application."

    "output": "The Reserve Bank has a legislative mandate to regulate the interest rate and foreign exchange markets which are critical for the resilient functioning of the financial system and the broader economy, and for ensuring financial stability. As part of this mandate, the Reserve Bank is tasked with the regulation, development and oversight of the interest rate markets, including the Government securities market; money markets , including the market for repo in Government securities and corporate bonds; foreign exchange markets; derivatives on interest rates  / prices, foreign exchange rates and credit. The Reserve Bank is also responsible for the regulation of financial market infrastructure, including financial market benchmarks, for these markets. The Reserve Bank regulates financial markets within the overarching statutory framework of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, the Government Securities Act, 2006, Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999, the Bilateral Netting of Qualified Financial Contracts Act, 2020 and the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007.\n\nFinancial markets play an important role in the growth and development of an economy by facilitating efficient allocation of resources and sharing of risks. Given its significance, the development of financial markets has always remained one of the key priorities of the Reserve Bank. Accordingly, the Reserve Bank has been undertaking policy reforms and regulatory policies in active coordination with Government and other stakeholders to develop safe and stable financial markets which facilitate efficient price discovery through increasing the depth and width of financial markets and provide appropriate products for trading and risk management. As part of this approach, it seeks to broad base markets by easing access, enhancing participation, facilitating innovation, protecting users and promoting fair conduct. With the growth of the Regulated Entities (REs), in terms of number as well as scale of operations, increase in adoption of innovative technologies and enhanced customer outreach, a need is felt to develop better industry standards for self-regulation."

    "output": "Technological innovations are reshaping the financial services landscape, with FinTechs emerging as both disruptors and facilitators. FinTechs encompass diverse entities in terms of constitution, size, activities, domains, etc., all subject to constant flux and evolution. FinTechs play a pivotal role in redefining financial services by saving time, enhancing access, and lowering costs. For the purpose of membership of an SRO -FT under this framework, FinTechs may be defined as entities that provide technological solutions for delivery of financial products and services to businesses and consumers or encompass regulatory and supervisory compliance in partnership with traditional financial institutions or otherwise. This definition may be taken as a broad guidance for deciding on membership eligibility.\n\nWhile the FinTechs bring various innovations, the FinTech sector also raises concerns relating to customer protection, data privacy, cyber security, grievance handling, internal governance, financial system integrity, etc. The approach to regulation of this dynamic sector needs, therefore, to be balanced, nuanced and reasonably anticipatory. In such a context, the framework for FinTechs also needs to be imaginative, adaptive, flexible, and proportionate to the perceived risks. In particular, a judicious balance between maximising the creative potential of Fin Techs, while minimising the idiosyncratic risks they pose to the financial system, is desirable. The oversight framework should be activity-based, risk-based, scale-based and phased-in as well.\n\nSelf-regulation within the FinTech sector could be one way of achieving this delicate balance. By pivoting towards a culture of self-governance, FinTechs could proactively set and adhere to industry standards and best practices. This approach could empower the sector to demonstrate its commitment to responsible conduct and innovation even in the absence of formal regulation. Through collaboration, the sector could collectively identify and address challenges, foster an environment where innovation flourishes, and guide shared commitment to ethical business practices. The advantage of adaptability to rapid technological advancements and evolving market dynamics could also be achieved by self-regulation. In essence, the path of self-regulation could enable the FinTech sector to align growth with self-imposed standards, be answerable to peer"

    "input": "Question: What are the characteristics of a FinTech Self-Regulatory Organization (SRO-FT)?",
    "output": "The SRO-FT should operate objectively, with credibility, and responsibility under the oversight of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). It should strive towards the healthy and sustainable development of the FinTech sector and, if necessary, identify a glide path to a phased regulatory and/or supervisory compliance. The SRO-FT should have the following characteristics:\n\n(i) True Representation of the FinTech Sector: The SRO-FT should derive its strength from its membership, ensuring that it is truly representative of the FinTech sector, including FinTechs that are currently regulated by RBI (e.g., NBFC-Account Aggregators, NBFC-Peer to Peer Lending Platforms, etc.) but excluding banks. The diverse nature of FinTech businesses means they can often operate across various domains. For example, some entities might aggregate both loan and insurance products, while RegTech providers develop solutions for a range of financial institutions including lending and insurance. Through comprehensive membership agreements that encompass a broad spectrum of industry players, the SRO-FT should gain the legitimacy and credibility to not only frame baseline standards and rules of conduct codes, but also effectively monitor and enforce them. This representative structure should foster inclusivity and enable the SRO-FT to draw upon the collective expertise and experience of its members, resulting in development of standards that are pragmatic, adaptive, and widely accepted within the FinTech community. The SRO-FT must thus be looked up to and accepted by the industry as the key body for setting standards, defining rules of conduct, and ensuring voluntary adoption of the framework contours by its members. Given the dynamics of the sector, it is likely that FinTechs could have membership of more than one SRO. Furthermore, the FinTech entities are encouraged to participate in at least one SRO.\n\n(ii) Development-oriented: The SRO-FT should be development-oriented, actively contributing to the growth and evolution of the industry. This involves prescribing minimum eligibility criteria for its members, providing specialized knowledge and expertise, offering guidance, and contributing to capacity-building through training programs. By fostering continuous learning and skill development, the SRO-FT should contribute to a more robust, competent, and mature FinTech ecosystem. Additionally, expertise of the SRO-FT should be instrumental in bridging the skill gap, providing early-"

It must also be independent from the influence of any single member or group, ensuring unbiased oversight and maintaining impartiality to gain the trust of industry participants and regulators. Furthermore, the SRO-FT should be a legitimate arbiter of disputes, providing a transparent and fair resolution mechanism to foster a stable FinTech environment. It should encourage members to subscribe to regulatory expectations, facilitating communication with the RBI and promoting compliance, while making sure its codes/standards/rules are not a substitute for the regulatory framework for FinTechs. Finally, it should serve as a repository of information, collecting, analyzing, and disseminating relevant data to support industry research, trend analysis, and policymaking."

    "output": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the transformative general-purpose technology of the modern age. Over the years, the simple rule-based models have evolved into complex systems capable of operating with limited human intervention. More recently, it has started to reshape how we work, how businesses operate and engage with their customers. In the process, it has forced us to question some of our most fundamental assumptions about human creativity, intelligence and autonomy. For an emerging economy like India, AI presents new ways to address developmental challenges. Multi-modal, multi-lingual AI can enable the delivery of financial services to millions who have been excluded. When used right, AI offers tremendous benefits. If used without guardrails, it can exacerbate the existing risks and introduce new forms of harm. The challenge with regulating AI is in striking the right balance, making sure that society stands to gain from what this technology has to offer, while mitigating its risks. Jurisdictions have adopted different approaches to AI policy and regulation based on their national priorities and institutional readiness. In the financial sector, AI has the potential to unlock new forms of customer engagement, enable alternate approaches to credit assessment, risk monitoring, fraud detection, and offer new supervisory tools. At the same time, increased adoption of AI could lead to new risks like bias and lack of explainability, as well as amplifying existing challenges to data protection, cybersecurity, among others. In order to encourage the responsible and ethical adoption of AI in the financial sector, the FREE -AI Committee was constituted by the Reserve Bank of India. The RBI conducted two surveys to understand current AI adoption and challenges in the financial sector. The Committee referenced these surveys and, in addition, undertook extensive stakeholder consultations to gain further insights. After extensive deliberations, the Committee formulated 7 Sutras that represent the core principles to guide AI adoption in the financial sector. These are: (i) Trust is the Foundation (ii) People First (iii) Innovation over Restraint"

    "output": "In 1997, IBM\u2019s Deep Blue defeated Garry Kasparov in a six-game rematch, showcasing machines' ability to outperform humans in strategic reasoning, inspiring early exploration in financial applications. By the 1990s, HNC Software\u2019s Falcon system was screening two-thirds of all credit card transactions worldwide. In the 2000s, ML models were deployed for specific tasks, such as neural networks for credit scoring, enhancing prediction accuracy with larger datasets. The 2010s saw the rise of deep learning and the introduction of the Transformer architecture, leading to large language models (LLMs). Landmark achievements included computers surpassing human accuracy in image recognition in 2012 and Google DeepMind\u2019s \u201cAlphaGo\u201d defeating Go champion Lee Sedol in 2016. Voice assistants and self-driving cars emerged. In late 2022, Generative AI tools like ChatGPT brought advanced AI to the public, reaching 100 million users in two months. Techniques such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures are further enhancing capabilities. According to the AI Index report 2025 by Stanford, AI systems now outperform humans in nearly all tested domains, with complex reasoning as the next frontier."

    "output": "The adoption of AI in financial services has accelerated globally. According to a 2025 World Economic Forum white paper on AI in Financial Services, projected investments across banking, insurance, capital markets and payments business are expected to reach over \u20b98 lakh crore ($97 billion) by 2027, contributing directly to revenue growth. The generative AI segment alone is forecast to cross \u20b91.02 lakh crore ($12 billion) by 2033, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 28 \u201334%. The OECD highlighted that AI is currently being developed or deployed by a broad range of financial institutions with major use cases such as customer relations, process automation and fraud detection. As AI continues to gain traction across financial services, it is beginning to unlock value by enhancing efficiency, accuracy and personalisation at scale. A key set of drivers underpinning this adoption includes the need to enhance customer experience, improve employee productivity, increase revenue, reduce operational costs, ensure regulatory compliance, and enable the development of new and innovative products. GenAI is poised to improve banking operations in India by up to 46%. AI -driven analytics allow institutions to better understand customer behaviour, manage risk."

    "instruction": "Answer the question based on the provided context from the financial report.",
    "input": "Question: How does AI enhance financial services, promote financial inclusion, and integrate with digital public infrastructure?",
    "output": "AI proactively optimizes operational costs and expands credit access through alternate credit scoring models. AI chatbots provide 24x7 customer support, and AI-based early warning signals enhance risk management. For example, J.P.Morgan reports that AI has significantly reduced fraud by improving payment validation screening, leading to a 15-20% reduction in account validation rejection rates and significant cost savings. AI also improves operational efficiency through automating repetitive tasks such as data entry, document summarization, and aiding human decisions.\n\nIn developing economies like India, AI assesses creditworthiness using non-traditional data sources (utility payments, mobile usage patterns, GST filings, or e-commerce behavior), including \u201cthin-file\u201d or \u201cnew-to-credit\u201d borrowers. AI-powered chatbots offer context-aware financial guidance, grievance redressal, and behavioral nudges to low-income and rural populations. Voice-enabled banking in regional languages allows illiterate or semi-literate individuals to access finance.\n\nThe 2023 recommendations of the G20 Task Force on DPI highlighted the need to integrate AI responsibly with DPI. India\u2019s pioneering DPI ecosystem, including Aadhaar and UPI frameworks, offers a robust foundation for AI-driven enhanced service delivery, personalization, and real-time decision making. Conversational AI embedded with UPI, improved KYC with AI and Aadhaar, and personalized service through Account Aggregator can enhance financial services. AI models offered as a public good can benefit smaller and regional players."

    "input": "Question: What are the key considerations and potential models for developing indigenous foundation models tailored for India's diverse financial sector?",
    "output": "In the Indian context, an important strategic question is whether there is a need to develop indigenous foundation models tailored for the financial sector. India's financial ecosystem is linguistically and operationally diverse, so any foundation model deployed in the financial sector must accurately represent this diversity to avoid urban-centric biases, calling for models capable of operating in all the languages spoken in the country. General-purpose large language models (LLMs) predominantly trained on English and Western-centric datasets may not be able to handle such multilingual diversity, and relying on foreign AI providers for core financial models could also expose systemic vulnerabilities. Small Language Models (SLMs) designed around a single use case or a narrow set of tasks, or fine-tuning existing open-weight models to specific requirements for the financial sector, could be resource-efficient and faster to train.\n\nIn addition, an alternate approach could be Trinity Models designed on specific Language-Task-Domain (LTD) combinations. For example, a model focused on Marathi (Language) + Credit Risk FAQs (Task) + MSME Finance (Domain); or Hindi (Language) + Regulatory Summarization (Task) + Rural Microcredit (Domain). They can support multilingual inclusion and regulatory alignment, making them suitable for the diverse ecosystem. Such systems can be built quickly with a moderate number of resources."

    "instruction": "Answer the question based on the provided context from the financial report.",
    "input": "Question: What are the operational, third-party, and liability risks associated with integrating AI into the financial sector?",
    "output": "Operational Risks \u2013 Systems under Stress: Even though the automation of mission-critical processes reduces human error, it can exponentially amplify faults across high-volume transactions. For example, an AI-powered fraud detection system that incorrectly flags legitimate transactions as suspicious or, conversely, fails to detect actual fraud due to model drift, can cause financial losses and reputational damage. Erroneous or stale data, whether on account of manual entry errors or data pipeline failures, can lead to adverse outcomes. A credit scoring model that depends on real -time data feeds could fail on account of data corruption in upstream systems. If monitoring is not done consistently, AI systems can degrade over time, delivering suboptimal or inaccurate outcomes.\nThird-Party Risks \u2013 Invisible Dependencies, Visible Risks: Since AI implementations often rely on external vendors, cloud service providers, and technology partners to supply, maintain, and operate AI systems, they can expose entities to a range of dependency risks , including service interruptions, software defects, non -compliance with regulatory obligations, and breaches of contractual terms. Limited access or visibility of into the internal controls of vendors can impair an institution\u2019s ability to conduct vendor due diligence and risk assessments and ensure compliance with outsourcing guidelines. In addition, there can also be a concentration risk that arises on account of a limited number of dominant vendors. There are also risks related to the vendor\u2019s subcontractors over which financial institutions have even more limited visibility and control.\nLiability Considerations in Probabilistic and Non -Deterministic Systems: AI deployments blur the lines of responsibility between various stakeholders. This difficulty in allocating liability can expose institutions to legal risk, regulatory sanctions, and reputational harm, particularly when AI -driven decisions affect customer rights, credit approvals, or investment outcomes. For instance, if an AI model exhibits biased outcomes due to inadequately representative training data, questions may arise as to whether the responsibility lies with the deploying institution, the model developer, or the data provider. Similarly, erroneous outcomes in AI -powered credit evaluation can occur."

    "input": "Question: How can AI be both a beneficial and detrimental tool in the realm of cybersecurity?",
    "output": "AI serves as a double-edged sword in cybersecurity. While it can be misused to launch more sophisticated cyberattacks, it also enhances the ability to detect, prevent, and respond to threats with greater speed and efficacy. New vulnerabilities arise at the model, data, and infrastructure levels due to AI's usage. Attackers may poison data by subtly manipulating the training dataset, causing AI models to learn incorrect patterns, such as misclassifying fraudulent behavior as legitimate in fraud detection. Adversarial input attacks mislead AI models into making faulty decisions, while prompt injection embeds hidden commands within routine queries to trigger unauthorized actions. Model inversion allows attackers to reconstruct sensitive data, and inference attacks enable adversaries to determine if specific data points were used in a model's training set. Model distillation involves adversaries replicating the underlying AI models to exploit proprietary AI. Conversely, AI can be utilized to execute cyberattacks like automated phishing, deepfake fraud, and credential stuffing on a large scale. However, AI can also bolster cybersecurity resilience, with financial institutions employing AI-powered tools for threat and anomaly detection, as well as predictive analytics to anticipate and counter cyber threats in real time. AI-enhanced security information and event management (SIEM) systems process vast volumes of data to identify patterns indicative of cyber threats."

The Financial Stability Board (FSB), in its 2024 report, has highlighted that while financial policy frameworks address some vulnerabilities, gaps remain, which may require continuous monitoring, assessment of regulatory adequacy, and fostering cross-sectoral coordination. The OECD, in its Recommendation on Artificial Intelligence, recommended the promotion of AI that respects human rights and democratic values and established the first intergovernmental standard on AI. Standards such as ISO/IEC 23894 (risk management in AI systems), ISO/IEC 42001 (AI management systems), and ISO/IEC 23053 (frameworks for machine learning-based AI systems) help institutions to ensure that their AI systems are fair, transparent, and ethical.

The European Banking Authority (EBA), the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), and the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) have all issued high-level principles or clarification as to how existing regulations apply to AI. Singapore, Indonesia and Qatar have a national AI strategy along with financial sector-specific guidance in place. South Korea, with its AI Basic Act, which will take effect in January 2026, and Guidelines for AI in Financial Sector, 2021 issued by the Financial Services Commission, has both national legislation and financial sector guidance on AI.\n\nSome countries have established specialised government-backed technical organizations to identify and address the risks associated with the use of AI. The primary functions of these institutions are research and evaluation of AI models, standards development and international cooperation. U.K.\u2019s AI Safety Institute (AISI) unveiled its open-source platform called \u2018Inspect\u2019 to evaluate models in a range of areas, such as their core knowledge, ability to reason, and autonomous capabilities. The U.S.\u2019s AISI convened an inter-departmental task force to tackle national security and public safety risks posed by AI. Singapore\u2019s AISI is focusing on content assurance, safe model design, and rigorous testing. The Government of India has also set up an AISI for responsible AI innovation. This Institute, incubated by IndiaAI Mission, has been set up as a hub and spoke model with various research and academic institutions and private sector partners joining the hub and taking up projects under the Safe and Trusted Pillar of the IndiaAI Mission.

    "output": "The importance of systematically capturing and learning from AI-related failures and incidents has been gaining global recognition. In early 2025, the OECD published a policy paper introducing a common framework for AI incident reporting. The OECD\u2019s framework is voluntary and designed to standardize the information organisations collect and report, making it easier to aggregate learning from incidents. The ISO/IEC 42001:2023 standard on AI management systems requires certified organizations to establish formal mechanisms for defining, documenting, and investigating AI-related incidents. The AI Incident Database (AIID), maintained by the Responsible AI Collaborative, is a public repository of AI incidents across all sectors, and allows anyone to submit reports of AI failures and near-misses, which moderators then curate and publish. Jurisdictions vary in their stance, with regions like the EU adopting mandatory, compliance-driven models, while others, such as the US, lean towards voluntary frameworks.

    "output": "The Committee conducted an analysis of select guidelines that may be relevant from the perspective of AI governance, including IT, cybersecurity, digital lending, and outsourcing. While the details of that analysis are set out in Annexure IV, an illustrative list of findings has been set out below:\n\nOutsourcing: The RBI outsourcing guidelines clearly state that the mere act of outsourcing a function does not diminish the liability of the organization, and that they should not engage in outsourcing that would compromise or weaken their internal control, business conduct or reputation. In this context:\n\nwhen REs employ AI technologies or models developed by third parties within their operations, this is not outsourcing, and internal governance and risk mitigation policies will apply to the RE in the ordinary course.\nif the RE has outsourced a service to a third-party service provider and that third-party entity employs AI to deliver that service to REs, this constitutes outsourcing, and the outsourcing agreement at present does not explicitly cover the AI -specific governance, risk mitigation, accountability and data confidentiality.\n\nCybersecurity: While AI systems have not been explicitly mentioned in the cybersecurity guidelines, to the extent that these systems use large datasets and are susceptible to threats like data poisoning and adversarial attacks, these guidelines may still cover the use of AI by REs in a limited way. The IT guidelines require REs to maintain transparency, accountability, and control over their IT and cyber risk landscapes, including an obligation to put in place access control, audit trails, and vulnerability assessments. These obligations may be extended to AI-based systems.\n\nLending: The RBI's Guidelines on Digital Lending state that REs that assess a borrower\u2019s creditworthiness using economic profiles, such as age, income, occupation, etc., must do so in a manner that is auditable. This can be made to apply to AI-driven credit assessments, ensuring that they do not operate in a black box and are subject to regulatory scrutiny and human oversight. Data collection by Digital Lending Apps (DLAs) or Lending Service Providers (LSPs) should be restricted to necessary information and require explicit borrower consent if they are used in AI systems."

Although the consumer protection circulars issued by RBI do not specifically cover AI risks, the principles set out in them would apply to the use of AI. Since the circulars also require the establishment of a robust grievance redressal mechanism, it would be desirable that REs should provide the customers with the means to challenge and seek clarification on AI decisions.\n\nDespite the above existing regulations, there are certain incremental AI aspects that the existing regulations need to incorporate to make them comprehensive, such as AI-related disclosures, due diligence of vendors on AI risks, opportunities and risks in cybersecurity, etc. A comprehensive issuance providing guidance on incremental aspects and applicability of existing regulations may be required."

    "output": "Most respondents largely relied on simple rule based non-learning AI models and moderately complex ML models, with limited adoption of advanced AI models. Simpler models were preferred due to ease of implementation, compatibility with legacy systems, and greater control and explainability. There was a preference towards cloud-based deployments for lower cost, scalable solutions and expansion of digital services, with 35% respondents using the public cloud. Out of the total 583 AI applications in production and under development, the most common applications were in customer support (15.60 %), sales and marketing (11.80%), credit underwriting (13.70%), and cybersecurity (10.60%). These functions typically involved lower risks, structured flows, predictive outcomes and easier implementation, making them conducive to early AI implementation. The cybersecurity applications mostly included third-party enterprise solutions that were easier to integrate with existing systems."

    "output": "The major risks that entities identified include data privacy, cybersecurity, governance and loss of reputation. From the FTD interactions, it was clear that entities were apprehensive about implementing advanced AI use cases owing to the inherent opaqueness and unpredictability of the technology and the governance challenges this entailed. It was also clear that mitigating these incremental risks required focused policy and governance actions.\n\nDifferences were also observed between institutional governance and risk mitigation frameworks. Only one-third of the respondents, which mainly comprised large PSBs and Pvt banks, reported having some level of Board-level framework for AI oversight. Only one-fourth of the respondents mentioned having formal processes in place for mitigating AI-related incidents or failures. Some of the entities confirmed that AI risks have been incorporated in the existing product approval and risk management processes, but that specific AI risk management verticals had not yet been implemented as they were still in the early adoption stage. Most respondents did not mention efforts at training employees and increasing their awareness of AI risks, which may hinder organizational readiness to handle evolving AI risks.\n\nMost entities did not have a dedicated policy for training AI models. Key aspects of the AI data lifecycle, such as data sourcing, pre-processing, bias detection and mitigation, data privacy, storage and security, were being handled in a fragmented manner. The entities relied on existing IT, cybersecurity and privacy policies for this. Most entities have not put in place the sort of data lineage and data traceability systems which are critical for accountability and model reliability. Many said that it was difficult to access domain-specific, high-quality, structured data, especially from legacy systems, and noted that there was a need to put in place data governance frameworks. Of the 127 entities that reported use of AI, only 15% admitted to using interpretation tools like SHAP or LIME, and only 18% maintained audit logs. Although 35% validated for bias and fairness, such practices."

This includes improving the availability of high-quality data, bridging infrastructural gaps such as inadequate computational resources, building capabilities for training, testing, and fine-tuning, and strengthening institutional and investment support; and ii) Challenges for Responsible and Ethical Adoption of AI, which relates to risks arising from the use of AI technologies. These include concerns around the technology, such as lack of explainability, bias, and hallucinations; around data, such as privacy, security, and control; around governance, such as managing third-party dependencies, ensuring clear accountability and liability; and around systemic risks, such as consumer protection, cybersecurity, model correlation and concentration. These two categories illustrate the dual challenge facing policymakers and stakeholders, i.e., the need to build an enabling ecosystem that fosters AI innovation, while simultaneously ensuring that AI does not cause harm. Addressing both issues is critical to building a trustworthy AI ecosystem."

    "output": "The Committee has formulated 7 Sutras - a set of foundational principles that will guide the development, deployment, and governance of AI in the financial sector. These principles are: \nSutra 1: Trust is the Foundation \n\u2022 Trust is non-negotiable and should remain uncompromised. In a sector that safeguards people\u2019s money, there can be no compromise on trust. AI systems should enhance and not erode public trust in the financial system. When consciously embedded into the essence of AI systems and not treated as a by-product of compliance, trust can be a powerful catalyst for innovation. It is essential to build trust in AI systems and build trust through AI systems.       \nSutra 2: People First \n\u2022 AI should augment human decision -making but defer to human judgment and citizen interest. While AI can help to improve efficiency and outcomes, final authority should rest with humans, who should be able to override AI, especially for societal benefit and human safety. Citizens should be made aware of AI-generated content and be informed when interacting with AI systems. Keeping human safety and interest at the core makes AI trusted.  \nSutra 3: Innovation over Restraint \n\u2022 Foster responsible innovation with purpose. AI should serve as a catalyst for augmentation and impactful innovation. Responsible AI innovation, that is aligned with societal values and aims to maximise overall benefit while reducing potential harm, should be actively encouraged. All other things being equal, responsible innovation should be prioritised over cautionary restraint.  \nSutra 4: Fairness and Equity \n\u2022 AI outcomes should be fair and non-discriminatory. AI systems should be designed and tested to ensure that outcomes are unbiased and do not discriminate against individuals or groups. While AI should uphold fairness, it should not accentuate exclusion and inequity. AI should be leveraged to address financial inclusion and access to financial services for all. \nSutra 5: Accountability \n\u2022 Accountability rests with the entities deploying AI. Entities that deploy AI should be responsible and remain fully accountable for the decisions and outcomes that arise from the use of these systems, regardless of their level of automation or autonomous functioning. Accountability should be clearly assigned. Accountability cannot be delegated to the model and underlying algorithm.  \nSutra 6: Understandable by Design \n\u2022 Ensure explainability for trust. Understandability is fundamental to building trust and should be a core design feature, not an afterthought. AI systems must have disclosures, and the outcomes should be understood by the entities deploying them.  \nSutra 7: Safety, Resilience, and Sustainability \n\u2022 AI systems should be secure, resilient and energy efficient"

    "output": "AI systems should operate safely and be resilient to physical, infrastructural, and cyber risks. These systems should have capabilities to detect anomalies and provide early warnings to limit harmful outcomes. AI systems should prioritize energy efficiency and frugality to enable sustainable adoption. The 7 Sutras operate as an interconnected whole, reinforcing one another to form a robust framework for the responsible innovation and adoption of AI. True to the Sanskrit origin of the word sutra, meaning \u201cthread,\u201d these principles are to be woven through the entire lifecycle of AI systems. They are the bedrock of the FREE-AI framework and apply to every institution that seeks to build, deploy, or govern AI in the Indian financial sector. They are not abstract propositions but are actionable principles. The 7 Sutras are: 1) Trust is the Foundation, 2) People First, 3) Innovation over Restraint, 4) Fairness and Equity, 5) Accountability, 6) Understandable by Design, and 7) Safety, Resilience, and Sustainability."

    "output": "With the 7 Sutras as the guiding light, actionable, structured, and forward-looking recommendations are set out under the FREE-AI Framework. The responsible deployment of AI within the financial sector calls for a dual focus approach - one that both fosters innovation and mitigates risks. Encouraging innovation and mitigating risks are not competing objectives, but complementary forces that must be pursued in tandem. Accordingly, the recommendations have been grouped into two complementary sub-frameworks, each addressing distinct but interrelated objectives. The first is the Innovation Enablement Framework that unlocks the transformative potential of AI in financial services by enabling opportunities, removing barriers, and accelerating AI adoption and implementation in a responsible manner. The three key pillars under this framework are: Infrastructure \u2013 Building the infrastructure needed to support AI innovation, Policy \u2013 Putting in place agile, adaptive policy and regulatory architecture to encourage responsible AI adoption, and Capacity \u2013 Promoting human skill development and institutional capacity to harness AI safely and effectively. The second is the Risk Mitigation Framework, which is designed to mitigate the risks of integrating AI into the financial sector. The three key pillars under this framework are: Governance \u2013 Establishing robust governance structures in respect of AI-based decisions and actions, Protection \u2013 Ensuring strong safeguards for protection from harms, and Assurance \u2013 Instituting mechanisms for continuous validation and oversight of AI systems. These should be integrated into policies, governance frameworks, operational protocols, and risk mitigation systems of institutions."

    "output": "To bring the FREE-AI Framework to life, the Committee makes 26 targeted recommendations which serve as a strategic blueprint to build AI responsibly and govern it wisely. In order to unlock the transformative potential of AI, an enabling environment is needed where responsible innovation can flourish. This requires foundational infrastructure, agile policies, and human capability. The recommendations are designed to enable AI innovation and are presented across three distinct pillars: Infrastructure, Policy and Capacity. Innovation is impossible without foundational infrastructure to support it. In the context of AI in finance, this includes data ecosystems, compute capacity, and public goods that can power experimentation. Equitable Access to High Quality Data is important, as most of the data in the financial sector is fragmented across institutions, registries, and platforms. Data availability is asymmetric, i.e., large incumbents have access to huge datasets that smaller REs lack. It is often stored in non-standard formats, making it difficult to use."

    "output": "To address the challenges of collecting, cleaning, and transforming data for AI in the financial sector, there is a need to establish a publicly governed data infrastructure (such as a data lake) which would aggregate and standardize diverse datasets from across the financial ecosystem. This would serve as a valuable resource for responsible AI innovation. This data infrastructure can leverage the AI Kosh \u2013 the India Datasets Platform being established as a Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) under IndiaAI Mission by MeitY \u2013 in order to leverage datasets from other domains, along with financial datasets. To ensure interoperability, the data infrastructure will enforce consistent metadata, formats, and validation standards. It would democratize access to innovation by making it possible for large and small players, FinTechs, and technology entities to build trustworthy AI services. The financial sector data infrastructure must ensure that personal and confidential data are protected. This would call for the use of privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs), anonymization, and data aggregation as applicable. Additionally, due care must be taken to respect intellectual property rights when using proprietary datasets. Additional conditions can be applied to ensure that models that use public data must be released as open source. Access to the data infrastructure must be governed by clear frameworks, in line with the National Data Sharing and Accessibility Policy (NDSAP), 2012, that ensure that entities can only use the data subject to usage obligations and accountability norms. To ensure transparency, accountability, and long-term credibility, the data infrastructure should further be governed by a neutral, multi-stakeholder arrangement among the financial sector regulator(s), industry, and academia and should be periodically updated. A high-quality financial sector data infrastructure should be established, as a digital public infrastructure, to help build trustworthy AI models for the financial sector. It may be integrated with the AI Kosh \u2013 India Datasets Platform, established under the IndiaAI Mission."

    "output": "The AI Innovation Sandbox is designed to offer potential AI innovators (including FinTechs, REs, and TSPs) shared infrastructure (such as computational resources, foundation models, quality data) that they can use to build, refine, and validate their AI models, products, and solutions before deployment. Supervisory authorities and financial institutions can examine how these models, products, and solutions behave in the sandbox before they are rolled out.\n\nThe AI Innovation Sandbox will provide infrastructural support for experimentation, model development, and the assessment of technical readiness without any regulatory relaxations. Access to the AI Innovation Sandbox should be subject to defined participation timelines, conformity with financial sector use cases, responsible platform usage, strong security guidelines, and clear exit criteria. This does not preclude AI-related applications from being a part of the regular Regulatory Sandbox, which will continue to offer regulatory relaxations etc., under its current framework.\n\nThe Reserve Bank of India is well-positioned to operationalise this initiative, either itself or through its subsidiaries like the Reserve Bank Innovation Hub, within the next year. Technical and compute support, such as GPUs and foundational models, could be provisioned through MeitY and the India AI Mission. Safe experimentation is an essential ingredient for innovation and must be offered as a public utility without compromising financial stability.\n\nRecommendation 2 \u2013 AI Innovation Sandbox: An AI innovation sandbox for the financial sector should be established to enable REs, FinTechs, and other innovators to develop AI-driven solutions, algorithms, and models in a secure and controlled environment. Other FSRs should also collaborate to contribute to and benefit from this initiative."

    "input": "Question: What measures are recommended to ensure inclusive and equitable AI adoption across the financial sector, and what specific initiatives are proposed?",
    "output": "To ensure that AI adoption takes place across the financial sector in an inclusive, equitable, efficient, and sustainable manner, the Committee recommends the establishment of dedicated plug-and-play \u2018landing zones\u2019 for shared AI compute resources that could be offered to smaller entities at affordable rates on a pay-per-use basis. Similar to the cloud infrastructure provided by IFTAS, the RBI IT subsidiary, these \u2018landing zones\u2019 could be offered as shared infrastructure facilitated by RBI or similar institutions such as NABARD or Umbrella Organisations for Cooperative institutions. These landing zones must enable robust isolation, ensure that the security responsibilities between infrastructure providers and participating institutions are well defined, and continuously monitor security to ensure safety and confidentiality. To begin with, these landing zones could leverage the GPUs being made available under IndiaAI Mission at an affordable cost. RBI could put in place incentive schemes to ease the cost of adoption for smaller entities. Other incentives to promote AI adoption should also be considered, either in the form of a model repository for open-source models or incentives for the use of AI models to serve the unserved or underserved. The RBI\u2019s Payment Infrastructure Development Fund (PIDF) model, which has been successful in promoting digital payments, could serve as a guiding framework for such incentives. These incentives could be offered based on clear metrics such as the use of AI to achieve incremental inclusion of new-to-credit customers or for setting up benchmarking services. To further support these efforts in a sustained manner, the RBI may consider allocating an initial indicative sum of \u20b95,000 crore as a corpus for contributing towards the creation of shared data and compute infrastructure as public goods and for fostering innovation in the financial sector. A part of the corpus may be directed towards building shared AI infrastructure, including compute and data, to democratise access. Investment in compute infrastructure should also include some that is quantum-based to ensure that its investments in AI are future-proof."

    "input": "Question: What is needed in addition to infrastructure for using AI in the financial sector, and how should financial services policies evolve?",
    "output": "In addition to infrastructure, there is a need for a clear, adaptive, and forward-looking policy framework that is aligned with the objectives of using AI in the financial sector. As AI technologies continue to evolve at a rapid pace, financial services policies must remain flexible, proactive, and future-ready. To achieve this, regulators must establish dynamic mechanisms that address emerging risks and foster innovation in a safe and responsible manner.\n\nGiven that AI is a new technology, there may be a need to revisit some of the existing policies to address the new risks that AI poses and unlock restrictions that may come in the way of innovation. There is also a need for periodic assessment to ensure that, as AI continues to evolve, the policies remain relevant and comprehensive to address the incremental needs. In cases where existing regulations already address AI aspects, regulators may need to guide REs as to how existing regulations will apply to AI. Where existing regulations fail to adequately cover AI-specific risks, review and amendments of guidelines should be considered. \n\nIn response to the evolution of AI, emerging risks, best practices, and international/national developments, Regulators should formulate a sector-wide AI policy framework anchored in the Committee\u2019s 7 Sutras that should serve as a living document that regulators periodically review and update. These should be viewed as the minimum baseline standards for AI adoption in the financial sector. By anchoring the policy framework in the Sutras, while having the flexibility to refine or expand, regulators can help foster a safe and inclusive environment for AI in financial services. Further, to provide greater clarity and enable responsible innovation across the financial sector and the broader FinTech ecosystem, regulators such as the RBI may consider issuing a comprehensive and unified AI Guidance. This may cover clarifications on existing guidelines, amendments and incremental aspects, which would consolidate AI-specific expectations and serve as a single point of reference for entities aiming to design, develop, and deploy AI solutions."

A rigid liability framework that punishes every mistake may result in developers excessively constraining AI\u2019s capabilities, undermining its potential for creating meaningful and innovative solutions. A tiered risk-based liability model, where the REs have the chance to rectify issues upon notification, would encourage responsible innovation.

    "output": "Reporting Entities (REs) should prioritize capacity building initiatives aimed broadly across the entire workforce, from the Board level down to anyone in the organization who uses AI. The direction provided by the Board and top management will become central to ensuring safe and trustworthy outcomes. At the same time, it is equally important for the broader workforce, particularly those involved in the development, deployment, and day-to-day management of AI systems, to be equipped with the appropriate functional and operational skills. The AI Competency Framework for public sector officials, developed under the IndiaAI Mission by MeitY can act as a reference framework. Institutions should also be encouraged to invite external AI experts into Board sub-committees or advisory roles, particularly when designing and deploying high-impact or high-risk AI systems. Where feasible, Boards may consider inducting members with specific AI governance expertise. It is important to distinguish AI governance expertise from general IT skills. While IT experts provide infrastructure oversight, AI experts bring specialised knowledge in the application of AI technologies, particularly in a financial sector context. Given the challenges of immediately sourcing qualified AI experts, a flexible glide path of two to three years would allow institutions to embed these competencies over time. Smaller financial institutions may be supported by SROs, industry bodies, academia partnerships and ecosystem collaborations. Collaboration may be encouraged between financial institutions, training providers, EdTech platforms and academia. AI technology entities are to develop specialized training programs to equip staff with new technical skills, but also build awareness of AI-related risks that could affect their day-to-day work. To help strengthen the training capabilities, educational institutions of excellence such as IITs, IIMs, etc., can develop and provide tailored course content on AI in finance. Scalable and inclusive capacity-building models and programs must also be developed to reach a wider base of the workforce, particularly in smaller institutions and rural branches."

    "output": "It is recommended to establish a board-approved AI policy within Regulated Entities (REs) to address the lack of consistent organizational stance on responsible or ethical AI use. This policy should explicitly articulate the institution\u2019s position on AI governance, ethics, and accountability, aligned with its values, obligations, and risk appetite. The policy should include a clear risk classification framework for AI use cases, categorizing them as low, medium, or high risk based on factors like customer impact and potential for harm. Additionally, the Risk Management Committee (or similar body) should identify, assess, and mitigate AI-related risks, integrating them into the institution's overall risk mitigation framework. An AI Adoption Committee, or leveraging an existing body, can bridge functional teams across business, risk, compliance, and technology departments, ensuring AI innovation and adoption align with regulatory expectations, ethical principles, and business objectives."

    "output": "REs must use autonomous AI only after establishing clear safeguards and accountability frameworks, supported by well-defined testing protocols and standard operating procedures (SoPs). Consumers should be made to fully understand the consequences before being allowed to use such tools. While exceptions may be considered for the use of autonomous AI in routine or low-risk tasks, human oversight remains a critical factor in medium-risk to high-risk tasks. REs must clearly define the tasks AI can perform autonomously and instances when human oversight is required. REs must remain liable for the actions and outcomes of the autonomous AI systems they deploy, just as they are for other forms of operational or technological risk.\nREs must implement robust model governance mechanisms covering the entire AI model lifecycle, including model design, development, deployment, and decommissioning.  Model documentation, validation, and ongoing monitoring, including mechanisms to detect and address model drift and degradation, should be carried out to ensure safe usage. REs should also put in place strong governance before deploying autonomous AI systems that are capable of acting independently in financial decision-making, especially for medium and high-risk use cases and applications.

    "instruction": "Answer the question based on the provided context from the financial report.",
    "input": "Question: What is red teaming of AI models and applications, and why is it important for financial institutions?",
    "output": "Red Teaming of AI Models and Applications is an adversarial testing approach designed to challenge AI systems to reveal hidden vulnerabilities, stress points, and risks. For instance, it can investigate if the AI model memorises and inadvertently leaks sensitive data such as account numbers or transaction details when queried in unintended ways. Since red teaming is proactive, it makes it possible for REs to anticipate failures and mitigate them in advance. This strengthens model resilience, prevents cascading failures, and enhances consumer and system-level trust in AI-enabled financial services. REs, which deploy medium-risk and high-risk AI applications, should make red teaming a regular practice conducted at periodic (at least semi-annual) intervals. For low-risk AI applications, red teaming should at least be conducted at the pre-deployment stage. In addition, red teaming should be carried out before all major model updates, after vulnerabilities have been detected, when there has been a change in the operational environment, or in the event of evolving regulatory requirements. Findings from red teaming exercises should be documented and made accessible to the audit/ supervisory teams, along with steps taken to mitigate them. Key insights should be shared as part of broader knowledge dissemination efforts across the ecosystem to support collective risk awareness and capacity building. REs should establish structured red teaming processes that span the entire AI lifecycle. The frequency and intensity of red teaming should be proportionate to the assessed risk level and potential impact of the AI application, with higher risk models being subject to more frequent and comprehensive red teaming. Trigger-based red teaming should also be considered to address evolving threats and changes."

    "instruction": "Answer the question based on the provided context from the financial report.",
    "input": "Question: What are AI-specific failures, and how should Business Continuity Plans (BCPs) address them in the context of AI systems?",
    "output": "AI-specific failures occur when AI models remain functional but produce unreliable outputs due to distribution shifts or evolving input-output mappings, for instance, a biased model may continue to deny service to a particular segment. In the case of such AI-specific failures, the challenge often lies in the fact that most models are trained with the assumption that the data encountered during deployment will closely resemble the data used during training. When this assumption fails, the model may continue to run without raising any flags, even as its outputs become increasingly inaccurate. AI-specific BCPs must go beyond traditional recovery strategies and incorporate fallback mechanisms tailored to AI failure modes. This includes having safeguards and fallback mechanisms such as mandatory human-in-the-loop reviews and continuous model performance monitoring. An AI model should be able to declare itself \u201cunavailable\u201d when it fails and trigger backup processes. Institutions should also conduct regular BCP drills in relation to AI-specific failures, simulating scenarios such as data drift and concept drift and implementing periodic human validation checks on a sample of AI decisions (e.g., 1%) to detect silent model degradation."

    "instruction": "Answer the question based on the provided context from the financial report.",
    "input": "Question: What should the financial sector do regarding AI-related incidents, and what should regulators do to encourage this?",
    "output": "The financial sector must promptly report AI-related incidents as soon as possible, with the reporting timeframe varying based on severity and system-wide implications. Regulators should design a system for aggregating risk data for macro-level insights, possibly via an expanded Emerging Technology (EmTech) Repository, and encourage transparent, non-punitive reporting. At the national level, analysis of such incident data should be channeled into inter-regulatory coordination forums to inform coordinated responses and strengthen sectoral resilience. Reporting what was observed, where and how it went wrong, and what remedial action was taken should be sufficient to enable shared learning. This will also serve as an early warning system and ensure AI adoption remains resilient, inclusive, and grounded in public trust. Where a customer has been adversely impacted, compensation must be provided by the RE, but reporting such incidents should not, by itself, trigger penal action if timely corrective measures have been taken and disclosure is complete. The objective is to foster a culture of early AI incident reporting across the financial sector, so that entities and the broader sector can adapt accordingly."

    "input": "Question: What are the key elements of maintaining an AI inventory within institutions and a sector-wide AI repository?",
    "output": "Trust in AI cannot be assumed; it must be built and, more importantly, sustained. The assurance pillar is the mechanism through which trust is continually reinforced and upheld. A key challenge in assessing AI risks is the lack of clear visibility as to where and how AI systems are deployed within institutions and across the sector. Without a structured and updated view of AI usage, it becomes difficult for institutions and supervisors to assess risk exposure or monitor changes over time. REs should maintain a comprehensive inventory of AI systems in use across their operations. Among other aspects, the inventory should include information on: AI Models and Algorithms: All AI models in use, including the type of model (e.g., machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, GenAI), their purpose, and the functional areas they support. Use Cases and Applications: A clear description of how each model is deployed. Dependencies: Third-party providers, cloud service providers, data sources, and any other external components that can influence AI model performance. Risk Categorisation: Assessment of each AI system\u2019s risk level (e.g. High, Medium, Low) based on the board-approved policies. Grievances: A record of the volume and nature of grievances filed in respect of these AI systems and how they were resolved. This includes information as to whether the AI solutions have been modified in response to user complaints. This inventory should be updated semi-annually and must be readily available for supervisory inspections, audits, and ongoing risk monitoring efforts. Maintaining this AI inventory will give both the REs and supervisors a view of where and how AI/ML models are being used to better categorise risk, improve oversight, and ensure responsible deployment."

    "input": "Question: What measures should be taken to complement institution-level visibility of AI models and applications across all REs, and what indicative information should be captured?",
    "output": "To complement institution-level visibility, a sector-wide AI repository should also be developed to collect and maintain aggregate information on AI models and applications across all REs. The EmTech Repository of RBIH can be leveraged by expanding its scope for this purpose. The repository should capture bare minimum, indicative information such as the types and number of AI models deployed across institutions, high-risk use cases, critical dependencies, incidents of AI model failures, ethical breaches, etc. This can also help in monitoring systemic risks such as model correlation and model herding, which, if left unchecked, can amplify vulnerabilities across institutions and potentially pose broader financial stability risks."

    "instruction": "Answer the question based on the provided context from the financial report.",
    "input": "Question: What should an effective AI audit cover, according to the guidelines?",
    "output": "An effective AI audit should cover:\n\n\u25cf Model and Algorithm Audit: It needs to certify that the model architecture, training methods, and decision logic align with the intended purpose and that the models are resilient against manipulation or misuse that could cause them to act contrary to their stated objectives.\n\u25cf Output and Behaviour Audit: It needs to certify that the decisions made by the AI model, such as approving a loan, flagging a transaction, or responding to a customer, are explainable, fair, consistent, and compliant with the applicable guidelines and principles and that there are safeguards in place to ensure these outputs cannot be misused or manipulated by bad actors. The audit should be tailored to the risk level of each application. For instance, internal AI audits for low-risk use cases (e.g., document summarisation) may be minimal, while audits of high-risk applications (e.g., such as credit decisioning) should be detailed. The audit should also confirm that mechanisms exist to stop, pause or unwind AI-driven processes in a controlled manner in case of malfunction or policy breach. It should also verify the presence of a Business Continuity Plan (BCP) for core AI systems and ensure that human oversight and override mechanisms are available for critical decisions. In cases where the risk is particularly high or where internal expertise may be limited, third-party AI audits by independent experts can provide necessary assurance. Audits should be periodic and evolving, with mechanisms to continuously update audit controls and coverage areas, considering new risks, such as agent-to-agent interactions.\nSupervisory audits should also evolve accordingly. Inspection by supervisors should include standardised AI-specific checklists and model risk templates tailored to AI systems, providing clarity on what aspects to audit, how to evaluate performance, and how institutions can demonstrate compliance."

    "output": "Regulators should facilitate the development of industry-led AI Compliance Toolkits to help REs validate that their AI models and applications meet regulatory expectations. These toolkits can serve both as a diagnostic as well as a benchmarking mechanism, enabling the validation of key AI risks. The use of the toolkit should be voluntary but strongly encouraged, especially for smaller and mid-sized REs that may lack internal capabilities. The toolkit could be developed and maintained by an industry body or SRO, or a consortium of financial sector participants. Third-party service providers should be encouraged to offer toolkit-based validation services, without regulatory endorsement. Regulators may periodically identify and share best practices to guide the continuous improvement of these toolkits. The toolkits would offer a baseline confidence level but not absolve institutions of their responsibility for end-to-end AI risk management, and are intended to complement, not replace, internal validations or oversight. An AI Compliance Toolkit will help REs validate, benchmark, and demonstrate compliance against key responsible AI principles such as fairness, transparency, accountability, and robustness. The toolkit should be developed and maintained by a recognised SRO or industry body."

    "input": "Question: Why is productivity growth significant in the Indian context, and how does the India KLEMS project contribute to understanding this?",
    "output": "Pro-market policy changes have altered the business climate for the private and external sectors, making the importance of productivity growth more significant in the Indian context. While many researchers have explored the productivity dynamics in India, their work was confined mostly to the formal manufacturing sector, which had relatively better data. The constraints on data for inputs and output at the detailed industry level made it difficult to produce a fair analysis of factor inputs and productivity in other sectors of the economy. A country\u2019s economic policies and investment climate are key components of factor accumulation and productivity, which drive economic growth. Therefore, understanding sources of economic growth is paramount to researchers and policymakers. In today\u2019s market-oriented economy, productivity growth is as important to fostering economic growth in India as it is in raising the living standards of millions of people in the world's second most populated country. Moreover, analysis of changes in factor inputs and productivity at the industry level is essential in identifying India's growth path to facilitate a pro-growth structural transformation. Evidence suggests consistent decline in poverty over the years in India. However, as home to the world's young population, India has vast human capital potential, if tapped properly. Additionally, market opportunities for investors, along with its resources, provide the potential to improve India's living standards. Productivity plays a key role in this process by improving production efficiency and helping generate surplus for additional consumption and investment. Overcoming productivity growth challenges requires a better understanding of the underlying features of productivity of specific industries. Since the 1990s, intensified global integration as well as global fragmented production chains have resulted in drastic changes in the global economy. This has created opportunities for many developing economies, including India, to participate in segments of the global value chain, where they have a comparative advantage, and further climb up the quality ladder. Increased productivity would help better position India in the global value chain and fend off the intense competition from imports which displaces domestic producers. It is this perspective that gives the India KLEMS project and the India Productivity Report added significance. The India KLEMS project follows the standards of World KLEMS and EU KLEMS, and provides a database on capital, labor, and intermediate inputs along with total factor productivity, thus facilitating a comparison of India's productivity dynamics with other global players."

    "output": "The India Productivity Report documents changes in the employment structure of the economy, featuring a fall in agriculture but stagnant manufacturing, and a shift towards service sector jobs. It analyzes energy intensity, revealing the need for policy implementation that encourages energy conservation in the manufacturing sector. Policy adjustments are also recommended to enhance India's human capital, emphasizing the need to accelerate improvements given the size of the population and labor force. The report also notes that while the country became attractive to domestic and foreign investors with the liberalization of the economy in the 1990s, hurdles still exist, namely stimulating investments in the formal sectors such as the much-important manufacturing sector. According to the Report the investment to GDP ratio in India has recently fallen. The need for reforming the labour market, improving infrastructure \u2013 both physical and human \u2013 and investment climate, are essential to stimulate investment and productivity. The report also highlights that taking into consideration various policy reforms, the trends in productivity demonstrate that productivity benefits from outward -oriented policies rather than inward -oriented ones."

    "output": "Economic growth and productivity at the global and country level is of major interest to researchers and policymakers. For India, a major emerging economy, productivity is the key force or driving engine for rapidly fostering the development and growth process. A swift, substantial augmentation of productivity would enable India\u2019s goods and services production units to penetrate in a much bigger way into the global export markets.\n\nWhile productivity can be measured using multiple approaches, the discussion here is focused on introducing the KLEMS-based approach to productivity measurement in the Indian economy. The KLEMS approach takes into account the roles played by capital, labour, energy, materials and services as inputs in output growth. The evolution of the India KLEMS research effort is aimed at building quality as well as detailed disaggregated data for analyzing growth and productivity at the industry level in the context of the World KLEMS initiative, which aims at construction of comparable datasets for cross-country as well as country-specific detailed productivity analysis. A review of global literature on productivity research throws up some very significant studies indicating the importance of analysing the contribution of productivity to economic growth. Indeed, the research focussed on productivity as a source of growth makes an important contribution to the literature on economic growth."

    "input": "Question: What are the different measures of productivity discussed in the India Productivity Report (IPR), and how are they categorized?",
    "output": "The India Productivity Report (IPR) provides a detailed analysis of India\u2019s economic performance since the 1980s, both at the economy-wide and disaggregated industry levels, based on the India KLEMS database, version 2019. Productivity measures are categorized depending on whether they assess this performance using partial or all factors of production. A Partial Productivity measure relates output to a single input, such as labour, capital or energy. Of these, labour productivity, defined as the ratio of output to number of workers or number of hours worked is, the most commonly-used. With GDP (Gross Domestic Product) as the measure of output and number of workers as the measure of input, labour productivity is closely related to GDP per capita, which is a measure of the standard of living in a country. On the other hand, Total Factor productivity (or TFP) relates an index of output to a composite index of all inputs. In studies of medium-term or long-term economic growth, the usual focus is on TFP as the measure of productivity. TFP growth is often associated with innovation and technological progress, the long -run drivers of per capita income growth. Another distinction is between productivity measures based on value added (VA) or gross output (GO). Relevant productivity measures may be selected for different analytical purposes in assessing a  country\u2019s economic performance."

    "output": "The India KLEMS project was initiated in 2009 at ICRIER (Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations) following a suggestion from Prof. Dale Jorgenson of Harvard University to late Dr. Isher Judge Ahluwalia. Stage 1 involved ICRIER accepting a working group\u2019s report and receiving a research grant from RBI (Reserve Bank of India). An advisory committee was formed, and the project was officially launched in 2009. The first major task was to construct time series data on gross output, GVA (Gross Value Added), and five inputs: K (capital), L (labor), E (energy), M (materials), and S (services) and factor income shares from 1980-81 onwards for 26 disaggregate industries comprising the Indian economy (later enhanced to 27). These datasets had to be consistent with the National Accounts Statistics (NAS) and other official economic statistics of the Indian government.  In Stage 2, since January 2015, the India KLEMS Project has been housed at the Centre for Development Economics (CDE), Delhi School of Economics, with continued financial support from RBI. The same team of researchers continued with Prof. K.L Krishna as the Principal Investigator. Every year since then, the updated data set and the data manual have been submitted to RBI."

    "output": "Global productivity research dates back to the works of Solow (1957) and Jorgenson and Griliches (1967). Since the World KLEMS research platform was initiated in 2010, there has been a continuous flow of research on sources of growth and productivity, with a primary focus on disaggregated sectors, incorporating the notion of a production function at the industry level. Following the success of the EU KLEMS project, Prof. Dale Jorgenson, Prof. Marcel Timmer and Prof. Bart Van Ark established the World KLEMS Initiative in 2010 at the first World KLEMS conference held at Harvard University. This initiative is a platform of more than 40 countries, encompassing Europe, United States, Asia and Latin America. Two major regional platforms were also developed: the Chile-based Economic Commission for Latin American and the Caribbean (ECLAC), which established the Latin American regional organization, LA KLEMS in 2009, and the Asia KLEMS network, set up in 2010, comprising Japan, South Korea and Taiwan alongside China and India. These networks organize several world and regional conferences and meetings. The core of these regional networks has been to construct country-specific KLEMS datasets. These conferences showcase research outputs in measurement and analysis of multifactor productivity with due attention to both country studies and cross-country comparisons. Productivity as a source of understanding economy-wide growth has been extensively researched both within and outside the KLEMS platform. Van Ark et al. (2021) provide a key recent investigation into the question of how to avoid another phase of sluggish growth after the global financial crisis, noting that productivity growth in advanced economies has significantly slowed, leading to the productivity paradox of the new digital economy."

    "output": "Dabla-Norris et al (2015) observe that trend growth in advanced economies has been slowing, driven by a slowdown in human and capital accumulation and declining total factor productivity (TFP). Dieppe (2020) provides an in-depth view on Emerging Market and Developing Economies (EMDEs) relative to Advanced Economies (AEs), using a comprehensive dataset for 35 AEs and 129 EMDEs, finding weak investment, weak TFP growth and fading gains from factor reallocation. The COVID-19 pandemic threatens to cause the largest and most broad-based decline in EMDE productivity growth. Fraumeni (2019) creates a foundational resource for understanding methodologies analyzing sources of growth and productivity for various nations using KLEMS-type models. Erumban and Van Ark (2018) report a drastic slowdown in global labour productivity growth since the beginning of the 2010s, driven by declines in TFP growth. Nomura (2018) identifies a post-crisis reduction in the TFP growth rate in Asia, mainly due to the decline in China's TFP growth and India's TFP performance. Hofman and Aravena (2018) report that Latin American countries have substantially lower labour productivity than developed countries, with a gap increasing due to the sluggish contribution of capital deepening and TFP growth in the region."

    "input": "Question: What does early research on productivity in India suggest?",
    "output": "Early research on productivity in India, while covering the aggregate economy and broad sectors, focused largely on organized manufacturing, with fewer studies on agriculture and service sectors. Bosworth et al. (2007) presented estimates of economic growth sources for 1960-80 and 1980-2004, for the aggregate economy and agriculture, industry, and services sectors. Bosworth and Maertens (2010) echoed this pattern. Other earlier studies include Dholakia (2002), Sivasubramonian (2004), and Virmani (2004). In manufacturing, studies indicated a slow TFP growth rate from 1951 to 1979 (Reddy and Rao, 1962; Banerji, 1975; Goldar, 1986; Ahluwalia, 1985). The 1990s literature explored biases in manufacturing productivity estimates due to value-added function use and single deflation. Balakrishnan and Pushpangadan (1994) used double-deflation to challenge Ahluwalia's (1991) assertion of accelerated manufacturing TFP growth in the 1980s. Subsequent studies mostly concluded that post-reform TFP growth in Indian manufacturing was non-existent or slower than in the 1980s. Studies on the unorganized manufacturing sector (Prakash, 2004; Unni et al., 2001; Kathuria et al., 2010) mostly reported a downward trend in TFP growth. Earlier research on the Indian service sector focused on specific sub-sectors like Railways, Airlines, Insurance, ICT industries, and Banking. For the services sector as a whole, Goldar and Mitra (2010) and Virmani (2004) indicated accelerated TFP growth after 1980. Banga and Goldar (2007), using a KLEMS production function framework, concluded that the services input contribution to output and productivity growth in organized manufacturing increased substantially in the 1990s, with trade reforms as a major cause."

    "output": "Productivity research on the agriculture sector has examined both the aggregate agriculture sector and sub-sectors like crops and livestock, including crop-specific analyses of major crops such as rice and wheat. Studies have found improvements in the TFP index of the Indian agriculture sector following the introduction of high yielding varieties. In particular, Fan et al. (1999) found a relatively faster TFP growth rate of 2.5 per cent per annum for the 1980s and a marginal slowdown to 2.3 per cent per annum in the 1990s, attributing this to the introduction of high yielding varieties, adoption of new technologies and improvement in rural infrastructure. Recent research has also focused on the rapid expansion of the service sector and the emergence of service-driven growth, providing much scope for research on issues related to the nature and implications of growth of this sector, including exports and employment. Furthermore, the servification of manufacturing and the impact of reforms in the services sector on manufacturing performance remain dominant research themes in the Indian context."

    "output": "Since the construction of KLEMS dataset with estimates of labour as well as total factor productivity growth by industries, several comprehensive research papers have been written by the KLEMS research team. These papers, using growth accounting technique as their core methodology, attempt to analyse the performance of the aggregate economy and its sub sectors during 1980 -2018. Prominent amongst these are Das et al. (2016), Erumban et al. (2019), Goldar et al. (2017), Krishna et al (2020) and Das et al. (2019). Their focus has been evaluation of productivity performance within different economic policy regimes, issues of structural change and growth and assessment of sources of growth for the Indian economy. In addition, Wu, Krishna et al., (2016) undertook a comparison of India\u2019s growth and productivity performance with China. A related work that compares TFP levels in India and China (Erumban et al., 2019) is in progress. Other studies include analysis of structural changes in employment (Krishna et al., 2016), trends in labour quality, (Krishna et al. , 2018), and growth and jobs - Indian experience in the international perspective (Aggarwal and Goldar, 2019). Further, issues such as ICT investment and growth (Erumban and Das, 2019), productivity growth and levels in formal and informal manufacturing (Krishna et al.,  2018), productivity dynamics in services (Krishna et al., 2016), structural change (Erumban et al., 2019) and a paper exploring India\u2019s trade-productivity linkage using KLEMS and other datasets (Das, 2019) have also been addressed. The research outputs of the KLEMS group bring several novel features to the analysis of productivity growth in the Indian economy.  Its period of analysis witnessed piecemeal deregulation from 1980 until 1991 and subsequently, long-term reforms in trade and industry that followed the crisis of 1991 -92.  Further, the high -growth phase (2003 -08) of the Indian economy followed by periods of global shocks and world slowdown in productivity allows examination of several research hypotheses, including the sources of growth and the contribution of productivity enhancement to the observed growth.  The construction of dataset for 27 sectors of the economy allowed disaggregated industry-level analyses, which enabled the identification of the leading sectors within groups such as market economy, market services and manufacturing. The industry perspective provides important insights when compared with the aggregate. Analysis of how growth of inputs and total factor productivity of each industry contribute to aggregate value added, thereby also determining each industry\u2019s contribution to aggregate growth forms a part of the research agenda.  The growth accounting technique allows for studying sources of overall growth as well sour ces of both labour productivity and total factor productivity growth. In addition, while assessing the explicit role of inputs when accounting for output growth, the contribution of the inputs to observed productivity gets captured significantly better whe n the construction of variables, especially labour and capital, allows for heterogeneity within inputs than cases where measurements of these primary inputs did not consider heterogeneity. Finally, the main dataset used in our analysis is the India KLEMS database on inputs, outputs and productivity trends for 27 sectors of the Indian economy from 1980 onwards within a growth accounting framework."

    "output": "The India KLEMS database is a database on inputs, outputs, and productivity trends for 27 sectors of the Indian economy from 1980 onwards within a growth accounting framework. The dataset, publicly available at the RBI website, illustrates to the research and policy communities the benefits of using detailed data. The India KLEMS dataset provides harmonized statistics on outputs, inputs and productivity trends for 27 industries comprising the Indian economy, covering a wide range of manufacturing and services sector industries. The dataset is constructed in a manner so as to maintain a close association with National Accounts Statistics (NAS), National Statistical Office, Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation, Government of India, with all variables benchmarked with the NAS database. It is freely downloadable and available at the RBI website. For the construction of the database, several supplementary data sources are used in addition to National Accounts Statistics (NAS), such as the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) data on employment and unorganized manufacturing, Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS), Annual Survey of Industries (ASI), Wholesale Price Index (WPI), Input-Output Transactions Tables (IOTT) and Supply-Use Tables (SUT). Several datasets not in the public domain were provided by National Statistical office (NSO) and information on several important variables had to be extracted using ASI unit level data. Based on the India KLEMS research project (2009-21), this facilitates economic growth and productivity analysis at a disaggregate level."

    "output": "Chapter 3 discusses the observed changes in structure of the economy, followed by growth decomposition at the industry as well as sectoral level in context of growth in value added. It goes on to examine the contribution of intermediate inputs to the observed growth, using a gross output specification of the industry level production function. It finds that value added share of agriculture & allied activities declined steadily over the past four decades and that of services sector increased from 37 per cent in 1980 to 53 per cent in 2017. A large part of this increase is on account of doubling of the share of market services from 15 to 32 per cent. Of the 6.03 per cent per annum observed average growth for the aggregate economy during 1981 to 2017, 2.03 percentage points came from market services, 1.21 from manufacturing, 1.26 from non -market services and less than 0.8 from agriculture and allied activities. Comparing growth in output with that in input, we observe a strong positive correlation between gross output and intermediate input growth. Further, it is observed that intermediate inputs share in gross output is relatively high in all manufacturing industries and within intermediate inputs, materials input\u2019s share is high across a majority of the sectors or industries.\n\nThe next two chapters, 4 and 5, provide an in-depth review of labour and capital\u2014two primary inputs used in assessing both labour and total factor productivity. Chapter 4 first discusses the profile of workers in the Indian economy and then an overview of the structure of employment during the period 1980 -2017. It also looks at aspects of labour such as, labour quality and labour income share, from an industry perspective. The main variables used are (1) employment (2) growth rate of employment, (3) growth rate of labour inputs, (4) labour quality indices, (5) growth rate of labour quality and (6) labour income share in value added. The India KLEMS dataset provides time series and cross section evidence of labour input for 27 industry groups. It is also the only consistent time series data available on employment by industry for different categories of labour input. Using this database, a detailed insight is provided on the role of labour input in accounting for output and productivity growth at both aggregate and industry level.\n\nChapter 4 offers several important insights pertaining to labour used in Indian industries. Employment, as measured by workforce participation rates have been declining in India, especially among rural females. Growth in employment in India also slowed considerably in the recent period and there was an absolute decline of eight million employed persons between 2011 and 2017. The level of employment declined in agriculture, mining, and manufacturing, and the growth in employment was driven mainly by construction and market services, underlying evidence of significant changes in the structure of employment. Further, during 2011-2017, the share of more educated workers significantly increased in the workforce. Another significant observation is that alongside overall growth in employment, there had been a significant growth in the labour quality index, leading to faster growth in labour input during 1980 -2017. The observed change in labour income share seems to have occurred mainly due to the \u2018within industry\u2019 effects in the sectors and structural change effects were small as compared to the \u2018within industry\u2019 effect. The real product wages had experienced a consistent increase in the average annual growth rate during the overall period of 1980 -2017. Finally, growth in employment and in labour quality index"

It observes an increasing role of equipment capital in the Indian economy, which helps improve capital composition effects, with capital services growth rates generally exceeding capital stock growth rates.\n\nChapter 6 examines trends in labor productivity and its possible drivers, deploying measures of labor productivity for broad sectors and 27 disaggregated industries. It finds large variations in labor productivity over time and across industries, with faster growth in capital-intensive and ICT-based industries. The analysis indicates that aggregate labor productivity growth is mainly explained by 'within industry' productivity growth, driven primarily by growth in capital intensity. Despite high labor productivity growth, the level remains low compared to other countries.\n\nChapter 7 provides a detailed examination of industry origins of India's growth and productivity, analyzing disaggregated industry-level production accounts for 27 India KLEMS industries and six broad sectors from 1981-2017, as well as sub-periods before and after the Global Financial Crisis."

The three main findings are:\n\n1.  Intermediate inputs were the largest contributor to the observed output growth across the 27 industry groups, primarily driven by the contribution of Material (M) input. However, the contribution from the Services (S) input was substantial for the services industries, signaling the importance of intermediate transactions within this sector.\n2.  Capital input was the second-most important contributor after intermediate inputs, especially for the services industries.\n3.  The contribution from labour input and TFP growth were negligible except for a few instances. Additionally, apart from the agriculture & allied industries sector, industries belonging to the services sector exhibited impressive contributions to aggregate value-added growth, a combination of high value-added shares and impressive value-added growth rates."

    "output": "Research on India\u2019s productivity performance has highlighted that factor accumulation rather than productivity improvements are behind the observed growth of the economy. Chapters 9 and 10 contributes to this literature by reviewing factor intensity, especially energy and capital intensities.\nThe analysis of capital intensity in Chapter 9 reveals that the Indian economy was increasingly becoming capital intensive, amid a falling relative price of capital compared with labor. Much of the recent expansion in capital services and capital deepening was in the market services sector. The construction sector was another sector where capital intensity had been rapidly rising. While these were primarily in alliance with the fall in relative price of capital, the trends in the manufacturing sector remain a challenging question--as the relative prices of capital in this sector were among the highest across the broad sectors of the economy, yet it continues to see high growth in capital per worker. The results of the econometric analysis of capital intensity indicate that the finding of a marked increase in the growth rate in real wages during 2003-2017 as compared with 1981-2002 fits well with (and may be treated as a major explanation for) the finding of an accelerated growth in capital intensity in the Indian economy during 2003-2017. A significant positive effect of real wages on capital intensity is found from both an analysis based on time series data and an analysis based on panel data.\nAnalysis of trends in energy intensity in Chapter 10 is confined to manufacturing, which accounts for a substantial part of the economy\u2019s energy consumption, with a focus on the formal segment of manufacturing at the aggregate and industry level for the period 2004-05 to 2016-17. A distinguishing feature here is that energy intensity is computed by taking a physical measure of energy. The analysis of trends in capital intensity has a wider industrial coverage, extending to the entire economy. The study covers the period 1980-81 to 2017-18.\nThe analysis shows several significant findings. First, in the period from 1980 to the end of 2000s, there was a downward trend in energy intensity in manufacturing, which got subsequently halted. The energy intensity series for aggregate manufacturing shows a mild upward trend after 2010, whereas the energy intensity series for organized manufacturing based on a different data source, namely ASI, shows that after 2011 there was a marked slowdown in the downward trend as compared with the trend prevailing previously. Second, the average annual growth rate in capital intensity at the aggregate economy level during the period 2003-2017 was significantly higher than that during 1981-2002. Decomposition analysis revealed that a sizeable part of the hike in the growth rate in capital intensity in the period 2003-2017 as compared with the period 1994-2002 is explained by the effect of the inter-industry reallocation of labor."

    "output": "The econometric analysis of determinants of energy use and energy intensity reveals a significant negative relationship between energy price and energy demand in manufacturing. An examination of movements in prices of energy and output shows that there was a fall in the real price of energy input in manufacturing in the period 2011-12 to 2017-18, and this could be one of the important factors that halted or slowed down the previously prevailing downward trend in energy intensity in manufacturing. Further analysis of trends in energy intensity using a time-series model finds the important role played by the real price of energy. The analysis brings out that movements in manufacturing sector output and real price of energy fails to explain fully the movements in energy intensity in the more recent period, and the reversal from the previously prevailing downward trends seem traceable to some factors that tend to raise energy intensity of manufacturing."

    "output": "This substantiates our assertion about the growing importance of services in the overall economy and offers evidence that high productivity growth in many service sectors underlies the current dynamism in service sector growth to a considerable extent. Economic growth in India and China has been often compared in the literature, as these giant economies have lately been the major driving force of recent global growth. These two economies share the experience of a shift from a socialist past to a market economy, which happened around the early 1990s. However, their paths to economic growth have been different. While China's growth was largely driven by the manufacturing sector, India relied substantially on its services sector. One of the important features of the country KLEMS datasets, such as the India KLEMS, is that they allow cross -country comparison of growth and levels of both labour and total factor productivities. Chapter 12 addresses that aspect of KLEMS database by undertaking a comparison of China and India\u2019s growth and productivity performance. This chapter compares the proximate sources of economic growth in the two countries, i.e., the role of capital accumulation and total factor productivity in driving labour productivity, using a comparable methodology and detailed industry-level data for the period 1980-2017. The analysis reveals that China's labour productivity had grown much faster than that of India over the last 40 years, thereby widening the gap between the two countries\u2019 productivity levels. A massive tide in its non -service economy has driven China's labour productivity growth compared with India, where the services economy did relatively better over the years. China performed relatively better in all the nine industry groups reviewed in this chapter, except for the financial and business services sectors in the 1990s and non -market services through the entire 1981 -2017 period. China's dominance in the industrial sector was also visible in its TFP performance. China performed better in the aggregate economy, agriculture, and industry, while India\u2019s service sector performance was much better. Our analysis tends to suggest that the Chinese manufacturing sector was significantly more successful than the Indian in creating productivity by investing in physical capital. The marginal productivity of capital has been higher in Chinese manufacturing compared with India. As already well -established in the literature, India's growth and productivity have been driven by the services sector, and our results indicate that more than capital deepening, it was the skill intensity of workers that appears to have had a higher marginal impact on labour productivity in the market services sector in India. Evidently, upskilling its workers had a larger productivity impact in India, primarily in its market services, compared with China. The capital-driven growth in China's manufacturing and skill -driven growth in India's market services are clearly brought out by our analysis in terms of the marginal productivity effects of these inputs in the two economies. Chapter 13 sums up the main findings of the study. It outlines certain data issues in the construction of the India KLEMS database. The chapter ends with a discussion on the way forward in terms of strengthening the database and in terms of the research to be undertaken based on the data."

The Report is based on India KLEMS database, 2019 in which data were provided for the years, 1908-81 to 2017-18.\n*   Data are provided for 27 industries into which the economy has been divided.\n*   The industrial classification adopted and the concepts used for the measurement of output, inputs and productivity are such that the dataset is comparable (by and large) to such datasets available for other countries. This facilitates international comparative studies on productivity.\n*   Details of construction of data series are available in the DATA MANUAL titled: Measuring Productivity at the Industry Level \u2013 The India KLEMS Database, Data Manual 2019.\n*   The main data source for constructing the KLEMS dataset (containing output, inputs, factor shares and productivity series) is the National Accounts Statistics (NSO).\n*   Supplementary data are mainly obtained from Annual Survey of Industries; NSS survey results in respect of employment-unemployment surveys and unorganized manufacturing (unincorporated enterprises) surveys; Input-output tables and supply-use tables.\n*   Deflators for materials and energy input are formed with the help of wholesale price indices; deflators for services input make use of implicit deflators for services in National Accounts Statistics.\n*   Gross output series and gross value added series are mostly formed from national accounts data. The gap between the two provides intermediate input.\n*   The materials, energy and services input series are constructed by splitting total intermediate inputs with the help of Input-Output and Supply-use tables.\n*   Labour input is measured as an index of labour service flows, taking into account changes in worker composition, in terms of levels of education.\n*   One of the widely used methodologies to capture changes in labour composition is given by Jorgenson, Gollop and Fraumeni (JGF) (1987), which is adopted for constructing the labour input series in the India KLEMS dataset.\n*   The growth rate in labour input may be decomposed into growth in labour quantity (employment) and labour quality (or composition effect).\n*   Capital input measure is based on a flow concept instead of a stock concept \u2013 similar to labour.\n*   The rationale is that assets are not directly used in the production process, rather the service delivered by these assets are the inputs to the production. The empirical measurement of capital services is complicated due to the difficulty in quantifying the flow of capital services delivered by a unit of capital. Therefore, the usual practice is to assume proportionality between capital services and capital stock at individual asset level (Jorgenson, 1963; Jorgenson and Griliches, 1967; Hulten, 1986). The service flow from a given stock differs from asset to asset. This is taken into account in the construction of capital input series in Indian KLEMS database.\n*   The growth rate in capital input may be decomposed into growth in capital stock and the effect of changes in composition. The breakup is provided in the dataset; further details can be found in the data manual."

    "output": "Chapter 2 discusses the sources and methodology of the India KLEMS Database. Accurate measurement of inputs and output is of prime importance in any study on productivity. While preparing the India KLEMS database, much attention has been paid to the measurement of inputs and output, considering the theory and international practices of productivity measurement. The database uses several sources of information and appropriate measurement approaches, largely consistent with the prevailing KLEMS approach (see Jorgenson et al., 1987; OECD, 2001; Timmer et al., 2010) to build a consistent data series. The India KLEMS covers 27 industries that constitute the entire Indian economy and provides annual data on primary inputs (capital and labour), intermediate inputs (energy, materials, and services), and output (gross value added and gross output) since 1980. This chapter discusses the methodology adopted in measuring productivity in the India KLEMS, along with detailed discussions on the construction of each of the above-mentioned variables, and factor income shares, particularly labour income share in gross value added, and the sources of data used in constructing them.\n\nThe remaining part of the chapter is structured as follows. Section 2.2 discusses the approach to measuring productivity in the India KLEMS database, which is the standard neoclassical growth accounting approach. In Section 2.3, the approaches to construct each variable along with the sources of data are discussed in individual sub-sections. It also contains discussion on construction of the series on labour income share in gross value added. Section 2.4 lays out some outstanding issues that may be considered in the future, and the last section provides a summary of the chapter.\n\nMeasuring the proximate sources of output growth, i.e., factor accumulation and productivity, at the individual industry level is an important feature of the India KLEMS database. To accomplish this, the approach we follow is the standard growth accounting, using both value-added function and gross output function frameworks. This approach requires data on inputs and output at the industry level.

    "input": "Question: What is the KLEMS production function, and why does India KLEMS assume a gross output production function at the industry level?",
    "output": "The most common approach to measuring productivity and factor input contribution to output growth is to assume a value-added production function, i.e.,\n\ud835\udc49\ud835\udc57,\ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc57,\ud835\udc61, \ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc57,\ud835\udc61, \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc57,\ud835\udc61\nv ) (2.1)\nwhere V is real value added, L is labor input, K is capital input, and \ud835\udc34 is an indicator of overall efficiency in using inputs in the production process, or total factor productivity (TFP), all for industry j and year t. In eq. (2.1), industry value added is a function of industry-level capital and labor inputs. Nonetheless, while this function is quite appropriate at the aggregate economy level, it is less appropriate at the industry level for important reasons.\n\nValue added is essentially a nominal concept, as there is no physical quantity of value added. Therefore, in practice, one derives real value added as a volume index obtained as a residual after subtracting intermediate inputs from the gross output. In the productivity measurement using value added function, this implies that the production function links technological change exclusively to real value added and primary inputs (OECD, 2001). Therefore, a value-added production function is valid only when intermediate inputs in the production process are separable from primary inputs. The conditions of separability are quite restrictive (see Goldman and Uzawa, 1964) and are mostly rejected in empirical tests by several previous studies.\n\nTherefore, industry-level productivity measures using value added functions are likely to produce a biased picture of technological change if technological change considers both primary and intermediate inputs in the production process (OECD, 2001). The production of one industry may crucially be linked to the output of another industry through the use of intermediate inputs. Due to such inter-industry reliance for intermediate inputs, it is unrealistic to assume industry-level technological change to happen solely based on the primary inputs. This makes the use of a gross output function to measure industry-level productivity more appropriate.\n\nTherefore, following the standard growth accounting approach followed in the KLEMS type of growth decomposition (see Timmer et al, 2010), India KLEMS assumes a gross output production function at the industry level. The gross output in any given industry j is assumed to be a function of factor inputs (capital and labor), intermediate inputs (energy, materials, and services), and total factor productivity, i.e.,\n\n\ud835\udc4c\ud835\udc57,\ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc57,\ud835\udc61, \ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc57,\ud835\udc61, \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc57,\ud835\udc61, \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc57,\ud835\udc61, \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc57,\ud835\udc61, \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc57,\ud835\udc61\ny ) (2.2)\n\nwhere Y is real gross output, E, M, and S are real intermediate inputs, respectively energy, materials, and services inputs.\n\nIt is important to note that both inputs and output in equations (2.1 and 2.2) are aggregates of many components. For instance, capital may consist of several types of assets (e.g., computers, machinery, or buildings) and vintages, and labor may consist of different skill groups, age groups, or gender. Following the KLEMS practice globally, in the India KLEMS we take the heterogeneity in labor and capital inputs into account while accounting for factor input."

For earlier years (1980-2011), for industries other than agriculture, mining, and construction, the historical series on gross output is estimated by multiplying industry value added data from NAS 2011-12 back series with the respective output/value added ratio obtained from back series with 2004-05 base. For service sectors, estimates of output are constructed with the help of IO tables, using the benchmark year gross output to value added ratio for the relevant service sector from IO tables for specific years, and these ratios are linearly interpolated for intervening years and applied to the gross value-added series obtained from national accounts to derive the output estimates consistent with NAS at current prices."

    "input": "Question: How is the output series created at constant prices, and how is gross value added determined and sourced?",
    "output": "To create an output series at constant price, the NAS estimates are used directly wherever the NAS sector classification matches the KLEMS classifications. For industries where direct NAS estimates are not available, the nominal estimates are deflated with value added deflators for the respective industries derived from the NAS. For industries for which we create gross output estimates using ASI and NSSO industry distributions, we first deflate the nominal series using weighted wholesale price indices (WPI) for the relevant industry groups, obtained from the Office of the Economic Advisor. The deflated industry series are then normalized i.e., proportionally adjusted to match with the published NAS aggregate real output of those sectors.\n\nThe gross value added of an industry is the value of output less the value of all intermediate inputs used in the production process. When measured at factor cost, it is the sum of compensation paid to labour and capital inputs (Berndt and Hesse, 1986). NAS provides estimates of gross value added by industry of use at current and constant (2011 -12) prices since 1950 at both aggregate and disaggregate levels in its 2011 -12 base back series. We use this series until 2011-12, and for years after 2011, we extend the series using the most recent national accounts data. Specifically, we use the 2011-17 data available from the 2019 annual NAS.\n\nThe KLEMS industries for which data are directly taken from NAS are agriculture & allied sector, mining & quarrying, electricity, gas & water supply, construction, trade, hotels & restaurants, transportation & storage, communication, financial services, public administration & defense, education, and health services. For the KLEMS industry business services, we combine the value-added data for three NAS sectors, which are \u2018information & computer related services\u2019, \u2018professional, scientific & technical services including R&D\u2019 and \u2018administrative & support service activities & other professional services\u2019. Similarly, we combine the NAS sectors \u2018real estate\u2019,  \u2018ownership of dwellings\u2019 and \u2018community & social services\u2019 (excluding \u2018education & health\u2019) to obtain the KLEMS industry \u2018other services\u2019. For t he manufacturing sector, the NAS provides separate estimates on value added in the  organised (registered) and unorgani sed (unregistered) segments until 2011-12. These aggregate estimates are split using industry shares from the ASI for the organi sed segment and the NSSO unorgani sed manufacturing surveys for the unorganised segment. For the unregistered manufacturing sector, we have used industry distributions from six rounds of NSSO unorganised surveys, which are 40th round (1984-1985), 45th round (1989-90), 51st round (1994-95), 56th round (2000-01), 62nd round (2005-06), 67th round (2010-11) and 73rd round (2015-16).\n\nHowever, NAS has not been distinguishing between organised and unorganised segments of the manufacturing industries since the introduction of the 2011-12 series. Instead, it provides a split between the corporate (consisting of both public sector and private corporations) and household sectors. As in registered manufacturing, we use the ASI industry distribution to split the value -added data in the corporate sector and the NSSO unorgani sed manufacturing industry distributions for splitting the household sector v alue added. The sum of registered and unregistered for the years prior to 2011-12 and the sum of household and corporate sector for years since 2011-12 are considered as value added data for the manufacturing industries in the India KLEMS database. It should be noted that the NAS series for the corporate segment of manufacturing is based on the Ministry of Corporate Affairs\u2019 MCA-21 database, which follows an enterprise approach compared to the establishment approach followed in the ASI.

For energy and materials, wholesale price indices (WPI) for the industries producing the input components are combined with relevant industry weights from input-output transaction tables. These weights change over time, using weights from the 1989 table for 1980-1993, the 1998 table for 1993-2003, and the 2007 table for the period since 2003. The individual series are then spliced to create a single intermediate input price series. For services inputs, where WPI data is unavailable, implicit GDP deflators derived from the National Accounts Statistics (NAS) are used. These implicit deflators are combined using industry-specific weights taken from the 1989, 1998, and 2007 input-output benchmarks."

    "input": "Question: What data sources and methods are used in India KLEMS to derive employment data?",
    "output": "India KLEMS primarily relies on the quinquennial Employment & Unemployment Surveys (EUS) because it covers the entire economy and uses a consistent definition of the activity status of the person since the beginning of the quinquennial rounds of the surveys. While the Population Census also covers the entire economy, it is often criticised for underestimating workforce participation rates (WPRs), leading to lower employment estimates. Moreover, the frequency of census estimates is once in a decade, while that of the EUS is five years, providing a more accurate picture of trends in employment. Although the EUS is often assumed to be understating population, it provides consistent WPRs. The estimates obtained from EUS are widely used for planning and policy purposes and by academic researchers. We use the WPR estimates from the quinquennial rounds of EUS , and population estimates to derive employment data for India KLEMS.\n\nDuring 1972-2011, the NSSO conducted nine rounds of EUS, following a comparable approach over various rounds. In addition, from 1989-90 to 2004-05, the NSSO had also conducted annual EUS based on a small sample, often called the 'thin rounds'. However, these thin round results are considered less reliable, as their reference period is shorter compared with the quinquennial surveys, thus overlooking the patterns of seasonal variations, and their sample size is also relatively small. More recently, the National Statistical Office (NSO) started conducting periodic labour force surveys (PLFS), which are aimed to bring out high frequency data on employment. The results of the PLFS are not exactly comparable with the earlier quinquennial surveys, and hence should be used with caution.\n\nThe EUS provides several concepts of employment, depending upon the reference period it uses (one year, one week, and each day of the reference week) to determine the activity status. We use the usual and subsidiary status (UPSS) definition of employment, which is widely considered a good measure of employment, and is also adopted by the NAS in its labour input method. Six quinquennial rounds of EUS are used to create the KLEMS employment series for the period 1980-2017. These are the 38 th round (1983), 43 rd round (1987-88), 50th round (1993-94), 55th round (1999-2000), 61st round (2004-05), and 68th round (2011-12) rounds and the PLFS, 2017-18.\n\nIn all the Employment & Unemployment Surveys , information about the person\u2019s principal and subsidiary economic activity is collected and an industry code is assigned for the principal and the subsidiary industry in which the person is employed. NSSO used National Industry Classification (NIC)-1970 for classification of persons employed by industry in its 38th and 43rd rounds of EUS. These industrial classifications changed in the subsequent rounds. While NIC 1987 is followed in the 50th round, NIC 1998 is followed in the 55 th and 61st rounds, and NIC 2008 is used in the 68 th round and the PLFS. Therefore, to create a consistent series over time, the starting point was to create a concordance between the 27 KLEMS sectors, and NIC-"

The 27-industry distribution of employment from EUS is then applied to the total number of persons employed in order to obtain number of employees, \ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc57,\ud835\udc60,\ud835\udc54 , in each industry by gender and rural/urban areas, where \ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc57,\ud835\udc60,\ud835\udc54 is number of employed persons for any given industry \u2018\ud835\udc57\u2019, sector \u2018\ud835\udc60\u2019 (\ud835\udc60=1 for rural and 2 for urban sectors), and gender \u2018\ud835\udc54\u2019 (\ud835\udc54=1 for male and 2 for female).\n4.  The estimates of employment for the intervening years between the major EUS rounds have been obtained by simple interpolation of the four segments\u2014rural male, rural females, urban male and the urban females, ignoring the outliers where the two closest rounds have then been used for interpolation. While, the estimates from the major rounds are centred around the mid -year of the survey rounds, i.e., July for 38 th round and 1st Jan for the other rounds; the interpolation has been centred around 1st October so as to coincide with the mid -year of the national income estimates which refer to the Indian financial year from April to March. So, the base is shifted to October while taking the forecasts.\n5.  Total persons employed for any given industry in a year are then obtained as the sum of the \ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc57,\ud835\udc60,\ud835\udc54 over the two gender and two sectors, \u2211 \u2211 \ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc57,\ud835\udc60,\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc60 .\n6.  The employment data is extrapolated backward for 1980-81 to 1982-83 period using the interpolation of the broad industrial classification of 32 nd round (1977 -78) and 38thround (1983-84). The broad sector data for 32 nd round is used as a bench - mark, because the 27-industry classification cannot be obtained for the 32nd round due to non-availability of unit level data. Concordances between the 27 KLEMS sectors, and NIC-1970, NIC-1987, NIC-1998 and NIC-2008 were formed and are available in India KLEMS data manual (Das et al., 2019)."

    "output": "After obtaining a time series of employment (total persons employed) in each industry in the India KLEMS for the period 1980-2017, India KLEMS also accounts for the heterogeneity of worker groups, under the assumption that the skill differences of employees will have differing impact on productivity. To account for such skill differences in the workforce, a labour quality index is constructed. The measurement of labour quality is essentially an attempt to distinguish one labour type from the other taking into account the embodied human capital in each person, which could be through investment in education, experience, and training. The KLEMS approach to estimate labour quality distinguishes workers according to their educational attainment and experience and weights each category's growth rate using their marginal productivities, approximated by their wage shares. Regardless of limitations of India\u2019s employment statistics, a labour quality index for India KLEMS industries is computed based only on education overlooking other dimensions such as experience.  The quality of labour force is of considerable importance in the context of productivity measurement, and one of the widely used methodologies to capture changes in labour quality is given by Jorgenson et al., (1987).\n\nThe growth rate of aggregate labour input in industry j ( \u2206 \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc57,\ud835\udc61) is defined as a T\u00f6rnqvist index of persons worked by individual labour types \u2018l\u2019 as follows:\n\u2206 \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc57,\ud835\udc61 = \u2211 \ud835\udc63\u0305\ud835\udc59,\ud835\udc57,\ud835\udc61\u2206 \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc59,\ud835\udc57,\ud835\udc61 (2.8) \nwith weights given by \n\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc59,\ud835\udc57,\ud835\udc61 =\n\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc59,\ud835\udc57,\ud835\udc61\n\ud835\udc3f \u2219\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc59,\ud835\udc57,\ud835\udc61\n\u2211 \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc59,\ud835\udc57,\ud835\udc61\n\ud835\udc3f \u2219\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc59,\ud835\udc57,\ud835\udc61\n(2.9) \nand \ud835\udc63\u0305\ud835\udc59,\ud835\udc57,\ud835\udc61= 0.5(\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc59,\ud835\udc57,\ud835\udc61 + \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc59,\ud835\udc57,\ud835\udc61\u22121)  \nwhere \u2206\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc59,\ud835\udc57,\ud835\udc61 indicates the growth rate (measured as log change) of persons worked by labour type \u2018l\u2019 for industry \u2018j\u2019, \ud835\udc63\u0305\ud835\udc59,\ud835\udc57is the share of worker type l in total labour compensation, measured as the product of wage rate (\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc3f) and employment (H).

    "output": "The volume growth of labor input can be split into the growth of employment quantity or the number of employed persons and the changes in labor quality index, which is due to the changes in the composition of workers in terms. Total persons worked in industry \u2018j\u2019 by all types \u2018l\u2019 in period \u2018t\u2019 is represented as Hj,t=\u2211l Hl,j,t. The growth in employment is defined as: \u2206 ln \ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc57,\ud835\udc61 = \u2206 ln \u2211 \ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc59,\ud835\udc57,\ud835\udc61.

The first term on the right -hand side indicates the change in labour input and the second term indicates the change in total persons employed in industry \u2018j\u2019. If proportions of each labour type in the labour force change, this will have an impact on the growth of labour input beyond any change in total persons worked. The index of aggregate labour quality thus measures the changes in the educational composition of work force of the economy. The labor quality growth rates have been computed using equation (2.11) for each of the 27 industries using five education categories namely: (i) up to primary, (ii) primary, (iii) middle, (iv) secondary & higher secondary, and (v) above higher secondary. The estimates are generated using five EUS rounds, 38th, 50th, 55th, 61st, and 68th and the PLFS rounds of NSO. They are then indexed to 1983 (38 th round) as the base. For years between the EUS rounds, the index has been interpolated, and for 1980, 1981 and 1982 they are extrapolated. Finally, the entire series of labour quality index is rebased to 1980, the first year of the India KLEMS database. In constructing the basic data used in implementing equation 2.11, the following steps have been performed: 1. Compute the distribution of persons employed by the five educational groups for all the 27 industries for the selected major rounds of EUS37 and PLFS. 2. Apply these proportions to the number of employed persons in different industries in the major rounds and PLFS to obtain the distribution of persons by education groups. 3. Estimate the earnings data from NSO which relates to mainly the regular and casual persons employed. It may however be mentioned that even for these two groups, for a large number of persons employed, the wages are either missing or given as zero. While the earnings of regular and casual workers are estimated directly from the survey data, the earnings of self -employed persons have been estimated econometrically and a Mincer wage equation is used to estimate the earnings for self-employed."

    "output": "The steps to estimate the labor quality index, following Jorgenson et al (1987), involve using the equations explained above and the data compiled in steps 1-3, which includes computing the distribution of persons employed by five educational groups, applying these proportions to the number of employed persons, and estimating earnings data from the NSO using a Mincer wage equation to correct for sample selection bias. For capital input estimation for the 27 industries in the India KLEMS database, capital consists of different asset types of multiple vintages, each with a distinct productivity profile. All the productivity calculations in India KLEMS use capital services as the input to production, which is estimated using the approach developed by Jorgenson and Griliches (1967), and outlined in Jorgenson et al., (1987). The main difference between conventional measures of capital stock and the measures of capital services used in India KLEMS is that the latter accounts for the differences in productivity between different asset types and vintages. To measure capital services, using the Jorgenson et al (1987) approach, estimates of capital stock for detailed asset types and the shares of each of these assets in total capital compensation are needed. Using the T\u00f6rnqvist approximation to the continuous Divisia index under the assumption of instantaneous adjustability of capital, aggregate capital services growth rate is derived as a weighted growth rate of individual capital assets, the weights being the compensation shares of each asset, i.e., \u2206 ln \ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc57,\ud835\udc61 = \u2211 \ud835\udc63\u0305\ud835\udc58,\ud835\udc57,\ud835\udc61\u2206 ln \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc58,\ud835\udc57,\ud835\udc61."

The final estimates are consistent with the aggregate data obtained from the NAS. The NAS provides information on aggregate capital formation by the industry of use for nine broad sectors. More detailed data on assets and industries are collected from the NSO. For sectors where investment matrices were unavailable from NSO, information is gathered from other sources (e.g., ASI for organised manufacturing and NSSO surveys for unorganised manufacturing) and benchmarked to the aggregate investment series from the National Accounts."

Organised and unorganised manufacturing are proxied by corporate/public and household manufacturing, respectively.

    "output": "Once the investment in each of these assets and industries is generated using ASI data, this industry-asset distribution is applied to the published aggregate NAS GFCF series for the organised manufacturing sector. From 1960-61 to 1971-72, ASI data are for the census sector, and from 1973-74 onwards, they are for the factory sector. To make these two series comparable over the years, the data prior to 1972 is converted to the factory sector using the factory/census ratio in 1973. Thus, after these adjustments, investment data is obtained for 13 manufacturing industries (according to KLEMS classification) by asset types, consistent with the NAS aggregate.\n\nFor unregistered manufacturing, the data required for creating the gross investment series for the 13 sectors are obtained from various rounds of NSSO surveys on unorganized manufacturing, specifically the 45th round (1989-90), 51st round (1994-95), 56th round (2000-01), 62nd round (2005-06), 67th round (2010-11), and 73rd round (2015-16). Unit level data has been aggregated to 13 industries using the appropriate concordance tables. NSSO provides net addition to owned assets during the reference year within the block of fixed assets, and this is used as a measure of investment. The investment series constructed for six rounds were interpolated to obtain the annual time series of unorganized sector gross fixed capital formation by asset type. As in the registered sector's case, once the investment by asset types across industries is constructed, the asset-industry distribution is applied to the published NAS aggregate GFCF in unregistered manufacturing to obtain NAS consistent GFCF by asset type and industries.\n\nTo compute asset-wise capital stock using PIM (equation 2.15) and rental price (equation 2.16), asset-wise investment price deflators are required. Since NSO has provided investment data by industries and assets both in current and constant prices, price deflators with base 2011-12 could be derived. For years before 2011, prices were spliced using 2004-05 base investment deflators. These deflators are directly used for all the three asset categories. Since there was no separate asset-wise data available for transport equipment since 2016-17, the investment deflator for transport equipment from 2016-17 was extrapolated using the trend in the investment price of total machinery & equipment obtained from NAS. For industries for which NSO data were not available, the deflator from the nearest aggregate sector is applied (e.g., for all the 13 registered manufacturing industries, the aggregate registered manufacturing deflator from the NAS is used)."

    "output": "For non-manufacturing sectors, the net capital stock for the year 1950 is used, while for manufacturing sectors, the same is taken for the year 1964. The industry-asset distribution of Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) for the benchmark year is used to create net fixed capital stock estimates by asset type for all 27 industries. Data from the National Accounts Statistics (NAS) on the assumed life of assets is used to derive depreciation rates for non-ICT assets, using a double declining balance rate. Consistent with the NAS, a lifetime of 80 years is assumed for buildings, 20 years for transport equipment, and 25 years for machinery and equipment, resulting in depreciation rates of 2.5 percent, 10 percent, and 8 percent, respectively. Capital stock series are built by asset types for all 27 industries using GFCF series from 1950 (non-manufacturing) or 1964 (manufacturing) onwards. Rental prices are estimated assuming that the flow of capital services is proportional to the capital stock at the individual asset level, with aggregate capital flows obtained using a translog quantity index. The rate of return is proxied by the average of return on government securities and prime lending rate from the Reserve Bank of India, and a real rate (net of capital gain) is used. The capital gain component is excluded while estimating rental price.  Specifically, the India KLEMS is based on the revised NAS with 2011-12 base, and detailed asset-industry data is available for 2011-12 to 2015-16. Data for earlier years are extrapolated using growth rates from the previous version of the data, with adjustments made for slight differences in industry groups. For years after 2015-16, publicly available data from the National Accounts is used.  Investment data for the organised manufacturing sector is split into 13 study sectors using industry and asset distributions calculated from ASI data, while investment series in the service sector is split using value-added shares.

    "output": "The basic data sources used for the computation of labor income share are the NAS (covering the entire economy), the ASI (covering organised manufacturing industries) and unit level data of NSSO survey of unorganised manufacturing enterprises. The NAS publishes data on net domestic product (NDP) comprising of compensation of employees (CE), operating surplus (OS) and mixed income (MI) for major industry groups. As in the case of GFCF, NAS does not provide estimates of factor incomes separately for registered and unregistered manufacturing since 2011-12, instead providing a split between the corporate and household sectors. The MI component consists of income accruing to capital and the wage income of the self-employed workers and is an important part of labor income in the unorganised segment of the economy. To accurately calculate total labor income, it is necessary to combine the CE and the portion of MI that can be attributed to wages of self-employed workers.\n\nTo compute labor income share, data on CE and MI are collected for all the NAS industry groups. However, only nine industry groups are directly comparable to India KLEMS industry classification. For the other sectors, the NAS aggregates were split using industry distributions from other sources.\n\nThe NAS estimates of factor incomes for registered and corporate sector manufacturing are split into 13 KLEMS manufacturing industries using the distribution of ASI data on total emoluments. For the unorganised manufacturing and household sector, the distribution of wage payments (to hired workers) in different industries from the NSO unorganised surveys is used. Similarly, the MI in the unorganised and household manufacturing sector are split across industries using the distribution of mixed income in various industries. The mixed income component has been obtained after subtracting the wage payments from the total value added in any given industry.\n\nUnlike the ASI data, the data for unorganised manufacturing enterprises are available only for the NSO survey years. The distributions for the non-survey years have been linearly interpolated, except for years before 1989 and years after 2016. For years before 1989, a constant distribution of 1989-90 is used, and for years after 2016, the distribution of 2015-16 is used, as the surveys used in this study starts in 1989-90 (45th round) and ends in 2015-16 (73rd round).\n\nFor the remaining service industries, the aggregate estimates of relevant industry groups from NAS are distributed across the KLEMS industries using their gross value-added share. Once the series of CE and ME for all the KLEMS industries is constructed, the labor income share in value added is measured."

    "output": "The value of \uf068 used in equation (2.18) is an average of the average estimates from approach 1 and 2. There are several data challenges and outstanding issues. For years prior to 2011, the NAS does not provide estimates of gross output of services sector industries, necessitating reliance on IO tables available at approximately 5-year intervals, requiring interpolation and assumption of linearly interpolated shares of value added in output for measuring output of services sector industries. Similar interpolation was necessary for constructing intermediate inputs, broken down into energy, materials, and services using the IO tables. Constructing detailed IO tables for India for each year would involve considerable effort but is needed to improve estimates of gross output of services industries and estimates of energy, materials, and services inputs. Furthermore, the estimated time series on intermediate inputs at constant price will not be consistent with the intermediate input at constant price implied by NAS data because NAS uses a single deflation method to estimate Gross Value Added and Gross Output at constant price.  A major data challenge in constructing a continuous time series on employment is the lack of reliable estimates of annual employment, requiring linear interpolation between major rounds of NSSO, which compromises annual fluctuations in employment and may affect annual estimates of labor productivity and total factor productivity. While the NSO conducts annual and quarterly PLFS surveys providing data on employment and wages, these are not entirely consistent with earlier surveys in respondent selection and survey administration."

However, it may be noted that the most appropriate labour quantity measure for productivity measurement is hours worked. The database had no option but to proxy it with employment, implicitly assuming that the changes in hours are proportional to changes in employment, due to lack of adequate information on hours worked in Indian industries. The problem with such an approach is that it can overstate employment if people are only working part-time, which may have important implications for productivity. The ups and downs in activity in the economy may impact the average hours of work done by the workers in India in a year, and basing the quantity measure of labour input on head count thus fails to capture this aspect which may affect the measurement of productivity."

    "output": "Two additional challenges are arising since the new system of national accounts. The first is the lack of separate data on registered and unregistered manufacturing, which poses challenges in using ASI and NSO data to split aggregate manufacturing data into 13 industry groups. Instead of the registered and unregistered split, NSO now provides a division between the household and corporate sectors. This challenge is currently addressed by considering the household sector as unregistered manufacturing and corporate sectors (the sum of public sector and private corporations) as a registered sector. The second challenge is the lack of separate data on transport equipment and machinery assets in the new series of national accounts, which follows United Nation's System of National Accounts (SNA)-2008. Although, for the time being, ad-hoc approaches are adopted to fix this, for the long-term, it might be necessary to combine transport equipment and machinery into one single asset. Finally, the debate on whether it is appropriate to use an external or an internal rate of return , is unsettled in the literature. It may be worth exploring estimates of capital using the internal rate of return. Some early estimates of the internal rate of return and the impact of using those in the capital service estimation in India (Erumban, 2021) suggest some effect, although not large enough to significantly impact any conclusions on productivity growth. A last but not the least point is the inconsistency between official statistics on GFCF between various sources. For instance, the reported GFCF series for the registered manufacturing differs substantially between ASI and NAS, as the two sources followed different approaches to gather data. This, however, is beyond the reach of India KLEMS database, although it is important to acknowledge the existence of such differences between the various sources."

    "input": "Question: What are the sources and methods used to construct the output and input measures for the India KLEMS database, including labor and capital inputs?",
    "output": "The measures of value added are largely taken from published NAS, complemented by Annual Survey of Industries (ASI) and National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) surveys on the unorganised manufacturing sector. Measures of output involved combining data from these sources with input -output (IO) tables. Additionally, the construction of intermediate input prices required combining intermediate input weights from IO tables with wholesale price indices of two intermediate input categories \u2014energy and materials\u2014and the use of implicit GDP deflators from NAS for services input.\n\nThe labour input is further distinguished between pure measures of quantity \u2014number of employed workers and measures of labour quality\u2014the skill composition of the workforce. For both the measures, the primary data source is the NSSO's employment and unemployment surveys and Periodic Labour Force Surveys (PLFS). The measurement of labour quality involved estimation of self -employed wages, which was accomplished using an econometric approach, using a Mincer regression (1974). Further, the NSSO and PLFS surveys in combination with the National Accounts (NAS) have also been used to derive the income share of workers in value added and output, or the labour compensation shares.  \n\nSimilarly, capital input, measurement of which is subject to severe discussion in the economics profession, has been measured after accounting for asset and vintage heterogeneities. By distinguishing between three asset types \u2014machinery, construction, and transport equipment \u2014and weighing the growth rate of each asset's capital stock by their relative compensation (or rental value) shares, we treat them as distinct assets in the aggregate capital input. For each individual asset, we also allow efficiency decline for older vintages by allowing appropriate depreciation of individual assets while calculating capital stock measures, using the standard perpetual inventory method. This way, as in the case of labour input, one can also distinguish between pure quantity measures \u2014aggregate capital stock and quality measures \u2014capital composition effect, or the share of high and low productive assets in the total capital stock. The basic data required for the construction of capital input, which included nominal investment, investment prices, depreciation rates, and interest rates, are mainly taken from NAS, ASI, NSSO unorganised manufacturing surveys, and the Reserve Bank of India.\n\nFollowing the discussion of the methodology and data sources, this chapter also identifies some outstanding issues that could still help further improve the KLEMS database . This includes improving labour input measures and extending capital input measurement to include information and communication technology assets and intangible assets. The data and variables discussed in this chapter and the industry aggregation groups provided in Annexure Table 2A.1 will be used in various chapters of this report."

    "input": "Question: What were the trends in India's economic growth after Independence, and what factors have been attributed to these trends?",
    "output": "During the first 30 years after Independence, the Indian economy transitioned from stagnation to a sustained, modest growth rate of 3.5% per annum. In the 1980s, the annual average GDP growth rate surged to 5%, and further to 6% in the 1990s. The growth rate picked up further in 2000. However, after an impressive average annual growth rate of 7.8% during 2001-08, the global financial crisis and the Great Recession led to India\u2019s economic slowdown starting 2009, and the growth rate declined to 6.8% during 2009-16.\n\nThe disappointing growth between 1955 and 1978, often marked as a failure of Nehru-Mahalanobis growth strategy, was due to the deepening of import substitution and industrial regulation, a reduced role of the market, and some exogenous shocks such as oil prices and wars with neighboring countries.\n\nThe subsequent gradual acceleration in growth, especially since the early 1980s, has attracted a lot of attention from economists and policy analysts, and a significant amount of research has been carried out on this theme. India\u2019s economic growth since the 1980s has been attributed to different sets of factors by different authors. For instance, Subramanian (2008) emphasizes that the skilled human capital created in the pre-1980s contributed to faster growth of both industry and services in the 1980s when pro-business policies were implemented. On the other hand, Bhattacharjea (2008) argues that the recovery of public investment in the 1980s could have influenced private investment favorably, leading to faster growth. Acharya et al. (2003) provides a more demand-side perspective, arguing that strong domestic demand, significant export growth along with liberal supply-side policies led to a high growth in the 1980s.\n\nGrowth performance in the decades of 1990s and 2000s attracted even greater attention because of the series of economic reforms carried out by India in the early 1990s. These reforms led to deregulation and liberalization of the Indian economy, which is argued to have increased the growth rate (Basu and Maertens, 2007; Panagariya, 2008; Virmani, 2004, 2006). Nayyar (2019) pointed out that rapid investment growth coincided with rapid export growth since 1991, leading to rapid GDP growth. However, the Indian economy lost this growth momentum in the latter half of the 1990s due to setbacks to the fiscal correction process and some slackening in the pace of structural reforms, which coincided with the onset of the East Asian financial crisis. With a recovery in its industrial sector and a sustained growth in services, India, however, regained its growth momentum during 2003-07 and became the world\u2019s second-fastest growing economy after China. Ghose (2019) emphasized that surging exports of information-technology related services and growing inflow of foreign investment and remittances fueled the growth acceleration, and a decline in foreign finance and remittances in the post-2012 period led to growth deceleration."

    "output": "Past analyses on economic growth in India are confined mainly to the aggregate economy or three sectors (agriculture, industry, and services) and hardly trace the differing roles of various industries within the economy in driving growth. Also, economic growth is analysed using value added, which is appropriate for the aggregate economy, but fails to acknowledge properly the role of intermediate inputs in the production process, while analysing industry-level growth dynamics. The India KLEMS database facilitates industry-level analysis of trends in and proximate sources of economic growth using gross-output and value-added functions. The data on gross output, gross value added, and intermediate input, along with primary inputs labor and capital are available for 27 industries that constitute the aggregate Indian economy."

    "output": "Based on India KLEMS data 2019, the value-added share of agriculture & allied activities in India has declined steadily over the past four decades, from 36 percent in 1980 to 18 percent in 2017. Conversely, the share of the services sector increased from 37 percent in 1980 to 53 percent in 2017. The share of non-market services (public administration, education, and health services) remained stagnant at around 20 percent, while market services (trade, transportation, business, and financial services) increased from 15 percent to 32 percent. Except for a slight increase in the mid-1990s, the share of the manufacturing sector in total GDP has remained stagnant since 1980. The share of construction increased from 5 percent in 1980 to 10 percent in 2008, then fell to 8 percent in 2017. The share of utilities and mining sectors remained stable. In terms of the percentage distribution of value-added shares across 27 India KLEMS industries, agriculture and allied activities had the highest share of more than 17 percent of GDP in 2017, followed by trade (10.8 percent), other services (9.4 percent), business services (8.4 percent), and construction (7.8 percent). Within manufacturing, chemicals & chemical products, petroleum & nuclear fuel, non-metallic mineral products, electrical & optical equipment, and transport equipment have shown an increasing share. Chemicals & chemical products observed the highest increase, from 1.2 percent in 1980 to 2.5 percent in 2017, whereas textiles & leather witnessed the highest decline, from 3.7 percent in 1980 to 2.1 percent in 2017."

The table provides a breakdown of various industries and their respective shares in the economy for the years 1980, 1994, 2003, 2008, and 2017.

Within manufacturing industries, chemicals & chemical products, petroleum & nuclear fuel, non-metallic mineral products, electrical & optical equipment, and transport equipment have shown an increasing share. The steep increase in share of services between 1994 and 2003 is due to expansion of the market services, of which trade, business services, financial services and transport & storage had high value-added shares in all five years. The share of business services had risen sharply from 1 per cent in 1980 to 8.4 per cent in 2017, followed by trade (increased from 6.9 per cent to 10.8 per cent) and financial services (increased from 2.7 per cent to 5.4 per cent).

This section (3.3) presents the growth rate of value added in the aggregate economy, broad sectors of the economy, and detailed 27 KLEMS industries. The aggregate economy and broad sector growth rates are obtained as Tornqvist aggregates of industry value-added growth rates, where each industry value added's growth rate is weighted by the nominal value-added share of that industry while calculating the aggregate value-added growth rate. Another commonly used approach is to simply sum the real value added across industries to obtain aggregate value added and compute the growth rate \u2014an approach often called the aggregate production function approach (see Jorgenson et al., 2007). The Tornquvist approach, which is consistent with the aggregate production possibility frontier approach described in Jorgenson et al. (2007), relaxes several assumptions in the aggregate production function approach, such as a common production function across all industries."

    "output": "The average annual value-added growth rate of the Indian economy was 5.3 per cent during 1981-93. The average annual growth rate in Gross Value Added (GVA) for manufacturing, mining & quarrying, utility, market services and non -market services was between 6.1 and 8.1 per cent, whereas it was 3.2 per cent for agriculture & allied activities and 3.9 per cent for construction. During 1994 -2003, GVA growth improved slightly, with construction and market services seeing a rapid rise, even though agriculture & allied activities, mining & quarrying, utilities, and non -market services registered a fall. During the 2003 -07 period, when the aggregate economy witnessed a growth acceleration (7.7 per cent per annum), two sectors that registered very impressive growth were manufacturing and construction. The most marked growth acceleration occurred in construction with a trend growth of 12 per cent during 2002 -07, while manufacturing observed a jump in growth rate from 6.1 per cent to 9.2 per cent. The growth rate of agriculture & allied activities also accelerated during this period. The overall growth rate declined to 6.4 per cent in the post -financial crisis period and the growth performance of all the broad sectors except non -market services appears similar to the aggregate economy trend.\n\nDuring 1981-2017, 19 out of 27 India KLEMS industries grew in terms of gross value added at a faster rate than the economy (6 per cent per annum). Business services grew the fastest at 11.9 per cent per annum. The other well -performing industries are post & telecommunications, electrical & optical equipment, rubber & plastic, coke & petroleum products, transport equipment, financial services, health & social work, chemicals and chemical products\u2014each growing at more than 8 per cent per annum. At the other end, GVA growth has been quite slow in industries such as, wood & wood products, agriculture & allied activities, mining & quarrying, and other services. The performance of agriculture & allied activities, which is essential for India\u2019s economic growth, was relatively very poor. It is also evident (Annexure Table 3A.1) that there is wide variation in value -added growth rates across the 27 KLEMS industries and across the four sub periods. More industries (10 of 13 that slowed) recorded slower growth in the 1994 -2002 sub-period compared to 1981 -93, while in the subsequent phase of 2003-07 the slowing was more on account of services\u2014five were services of the seven industries that slowed their pace of growth."

At the other end, there are industries such as, wood & wood products, rubber & plastic products, other services, agriculture and allied activities and public administration, which registered less than 5 per cent per annum growth rate during this phase. Value-added growth rates declined over  these two sub-periods in most industries. Out of 27 KLEMS industries, only nine recorded increased growth. The decline in growth rate is much more for the industrial sector. So, the improved growth performance of the Indian economy during 2003-07 and economic slowdown after the 2008 financial crisis are largely on account of the manufacturing sector."

    "output": "The extent to which an industry can explain differences in aggregate growth depends not only on its growth rate, but also on its share in value added. Another way to observe this divergence between value-added share and growth in individual industries is to calculate the contribution of each industry to total economic growth. This is done by multiplying individual industry growth with gross value-added share of that industry. In Figures 3.6 and 3.7, the contribution of broad sectors and the 27 industries to the aggregate economy GVA growth are plotted. Services have been the best performing sector in the Indian economy, both in terms of its value-added share and its growth rate. The sector\u2019s contribution to aggregate economic growth more than doubled from 2.1 per cent in 1981 to 4.2 per cent in 2017. The contribution of market services increased significantly from less than 1 per cent in 1981 to 2.4 per cent in 2017. The contribution of the manufacturing sector for the entire period has been around 1.2 per cent. Agriculture has contributed less than 0.8 per cent. The Indian economy had crossed the barrier of growth of 9.5 per cent in 1988 when agriculture contributed almost 4.4 per cent of the share. Clearly, for the economy to grow at such a rapid pace, such substantive contribution of the agriculture sector was vital."

Market and non -market services contributed 1.19 and 1.44 percentage points, respectively and agriculture contributed 1 percentage point. The contribution of industry was 1.72 percentage points, with 1 percentage point coming from the manufacturing sector. The picture changed during the period 1994-2002, when contribution of agriculture and non -market services declined significantly, whereas industry\u2019s contribution remained stagnant.

Indian economy achieved impressive growth during the 2003-2007 period with improvement from 5.7 per cent to 7.7 per cent. This improvement in GVA growth was reflected in almost all segments of the economy, except in the non -market services. Contribution of manufacturing and construction sector to aggregate value -added growth improved significantly. During 2008 -2017, aggregate value -added growth rate declined.

The combined share in value-added of these 8 industries is around 50 per cent.

Comparing the contribution of factor inputs\u2014material, energy, services, labour and capital, material input is the dominant source of growth for a majority of the industries. The contribution of energy and services input to output growth has been relatively low as compared to that of material input. Except for agriculture and allied sector and some services (trade, financial services, business services, public administration, education, health, and other services) more than 50 per cent output growth was achieved because of growth in intermediate inputs. Material input contributed significantly to gross output growth in certain industries such as, manufacturing n.e.c., coke & petroleum products, rubber & plastic products, electrical & optical products, chemical products. The industries where the contribution of material input to output growth was less than 0.5 percentage points are agriculture, education, trade, public administration, and financial services. The contribution of energy input was the highest in transport & storage, electricity, gas & water supply and other non-metallic mineral products and services input contribution to output growth was the highest in business services, transport & storage, manufacturing n.e.c., electricity, gas & water supply, and financial services."

    "input": "Question: What are the key trends in India's economic growth and the role of different sectors from 1980 to 2017, as analyzed by the India KLEMS project?",
    "output": "Based on the constructed time series from the India KLEMS project, this chapter has analysed the trend growth of GVA, GVO and intermediate inputs \u2014materials, energy and services input for 27 industries of the Indian economy for the period 1980 -2017. This analysis was conducted in two parts: first, examining the structure and trends at the level of disaggregated 27 industries as well as at the level of the broad sectors of the economy. Second, the growth rate of gross output and intermediate inputs \u2014materials, energy and services inputs was examined, and the contribution of intermediate inputs in output growth was analyzed.\n\nOne of the most interesting features of the Indian economy since the 1980s is the emergence of services as the dominant sector and as the main driver of GDP growth. Among fast-growing developing countries, India is distinctive for the role played by the service sector. Whereas earlier developers grew on the basis of exports of labour-intensive manufactures, India has concentrated on services. Although there are other emerging markets where the share of services in GDP exceeds the share of manufacturing, India stands out for the size and dynamism of its service sector. India\u2019s service sector observed an increase in its share in aggregate GVA from nearly 37 percent to more than 53 percent between 1980 and 2017. The share of agriculture in aggregate GVA declined by 19 percentage points and that of manufacturing remained at around 17 per cent during the period. In terms of GVA shares of 27 industries in 2017, although agriculture and allied activities share declined by 19.1 percentage points, it was still the largest sector with 17.2 per cent share in 2017. Further, seven of the top 10 industries in terms of GVA share were from the service sector.\n\nThe Indian economy grew at 6.03 per cent per annum during 1981 to 2017 and the growth improved over different sub-periods until the 2008 global financial crisis. While growth in aggregate value-added the Indian economy was between 5 to 6 per cent during 1981-2002, it improved to 7.65 per cent during 2003-07, and then declined slightly to 6.43 per cent in the subsequent sub-period. In terms of broad sectors, services grew at a faster rate (7.31 per cent per annum) than others, while agriculture grew at a much slower rate (3.06 per cent per annum). Market services such as business services, post & telecommunication, and financial services registered much faster growth than non-market services industries such as, health & social work and education & public administration. Within the manufacturing sector, electrical & optical equipment, rubber & plastic products, coke & petroleum products, and transport equipment grew faster than other industries. Of the average growth of 6.03 per cent per annum for the aggregate economy during 1981-2017, 2.03 percentage points came from market services, 1.21 and 1.26 percentage points from manufacturing and non-market services respectively, and less than 0.8 percentage points from agriculture and allied sector. Within the market services, business services and trade contributed most.\n\nThe analysis reveals a more prominent effect of the global financial crisis at the disaggregate industry level. For as many as 19 of the 27 KLEMS industries, growth rates declined after 2007-08.\n\nThe annual growth rate of gross output varied across industries ranging from 1.16 per cent in wood & wood products to 12.4 per cent in business services. Out of 27 industries, 12 observed higher growth rates compared with the industry mean\u2014 among them, eight industries are from the manufacturing sector. Agriculture and mining grew at much slower rates than the industry mean of 7.39 per cent per annum, respectively 2.81 and 5.50 per cent. Positive correlation between gross output and intermediate input growth is also observed."

    "instruction": "Answer the question based on the provided context from the financial report.",
    "input": "Question: What is the contribution of intermediate inputs to the growth of gross output in the Indian economy, and why is gross output preferred over value-added in productivity analysis?",
    "output": "In the context of the contributions of intermediate inputs to growth in gross output in the Indian economy between 1981 and 2017, the contribution of materials input is generally higher than the other factors of production, reaching 40 to 50 percent in manufacturing industries. Except for transportation & storage, electricity, gas & water supply, non-metallic mineral and metal products, the contribution of energy input is negligible (less than 3 percent), while the contribution of service inputs to gross output lies between 10 to 20 percent.  Evidently, the contribution of intermediate input, particularly material input, remained the dominant source of output growth for most industries. Therefore, intermediate inputs play a crucial role in explaining economic growth at the industry level, which is why gross output is preferred instead of value-added in productivity analysis."

    "input": "Question: What are the key challenges and transformations in India's employment landscape, and how does the India KLEMS project address data limitations in analyzing productivity?",
    "output": "Providing gainful employment to its workforce has always been an integral aspect of economic development in any country. However, the problem of job creation has been worsening in several countries owing to multiple factors, including changes in the structure of the labour market. According to ILO (2014), the process of globalisation has also aided the \u2018precarisation\u2019 of labour in many countries. India has not remained unaffected by labour market changes and faces similar employment challenges.\n\nThe Indian economy has experienced some structural transformations in both GDP and employment after the 1990s economic reforms. However, the structural transformation in employment has been slow as compared to that in GDP. The past few years have also created a situation of inadequate job creation despite reasonably strong economic growth. India\u2019s GDP grew at an average rate of 7.3 per cent over the of the period 2014 -18, but this growth did not create enough jobs--the increase in employment has not been commensurate with the increase in the workforce. The Indian economy has been slowing since 2016-17 with a continuous fall in its GDP growth rate from 8.26 per cent to 6.8 per cent per annum during 2017-18 and the total unemployment rate by usual status has gone up significantly from 2.2 per cent in 2011-12 to 6.1 per cent in 2017-18. During the same period, the youth unemployment rate (15-29 years) also shot up across all segments--rural and urban, and males and females. Some of the reasons pointed out for the recent slowdown in the Indian economy (Nagraj, 2020) are: (i) a decline in the rate of savings and gross capital formation, (ii) unfavourable macro-economic situation with rise in international oil prices, and (iii) a slowdown in GDP of many other countries-post financial crisis of 2008-09, leading to a fall in India\u2019s exports.\n\nThe challenge then is to bring the Indian economy back to a faster-growth trajectory and accelerate the process of structural transformation. One of the important routes to achieve that objective is through increase in the growth rate of productivity. But an insight into any analysis of productivity requires data on output and inputs--both labour and capital--for the aggregate economy and at the disaggregated industry level. Due to the lack of availability of any such data in a continuous time series, the India KLEMS project, took on the challenge to build a credible time series for the required data, including an employment series.\n\nBecause of the limitations of reliable official data on employment, there are differences of opinion on the actual trend in employment in the recent past. Based on the available data sources, different authors have estimated employment in India for different time periods, but some of these estimates differ from each other mainly due to (i) different estimates of projected population, (ii) use of different employment status and age groups, (iii) different reference periods. The sources and problems of employment statistics in India have been widely discussed in the literature."

    "input": "Question: What are the trends in employment, labor quality index growth, and labor income share in India since 1980-81, based on the India KLEMS (2019) employment series?",
    "output": "Based on the employment series constructed for India KLEMS (2019), trends in employment and the causes underlying slow employment growth in India, as well as trends in the growth of the labour quality index and labour income share have been analyzed. The workforce participation rate (WFPR) of male and female workers employed in Usual Status (usual principal and subsidiary status or UPSS) in rural and urban sectors since 1983 in all major rounds and PLFS (2017 -18) are summarized in Table 4.1. It can be observed that the total WFPR was largely stagnant at around 42 per cent between 1983 and 2004 -05. There has been a decline since then, and by 2017-18, the figure had declined to as low as 34.7 per cent. On comparing, we observe that the WFPR in urban areas has always been lower than in rural India, but the gap has narrowed down over the period from 10 percentage points in 1983 to just 4 points in 2011 -12, and subsequently to only one percentage point in 2017 -18. This convergence between the rural and urban sectors has come mainly because of a fall in the rural WFPR by 9 percentage points -from 44.5 per cent to 35 per cent. In general, the WFPR has been much lower among females, both in rural and urban sectors, than among their male counterparts. It was only 16.5 per cent for females against 52 per cent for males in 2017 -18. However, while the urban female WFPR has remained stable around 15 per cent, the rural female workforce participation rate has declined by almost half from 34 per cent to 17.5 per cent from 1983 to 2017. A number of explanations have been put forward in the literature for the low WFPR among females. Predominant among them is the \u2018distressed employment\u2019 hypothesis, which argues that rural females take up work only during distress and if the economy is doing well, they tend to withdraw from the workforce (Ghose, 2016; Mehrotra and Sinha, 2017 ). Another plausible explanation is that an increasing number of females are joining and staying in schools and colleges (Mehrotra et al., 2014; Thomas, 2015, Ghose, 2016) or attending to domestic duties (Thomas, 2015). As incomes rise further, a larger proportion of women are seen to work again. Thus, a U-shaped relationship is found between female WFPR and economic development (Tam, 2011). Another explanation focuses on increasing measurement errors in work participation data from the National Sample Surveys (Himanshu 2011; Hirway 2012). "

    "input": "Question: What factors contribute to the low workforce participation rate (WFPR) of females in India compared to other countries, and what policy interventions are necessary to address this disparity?",
    "output": "The WFPR of females in India is relatively very low, at a mere 27 per cent in 2016, compared with 80 per cent in Nepal, 67 per cent in Bhutan, 64 per cent in China, and 59 per cent in Brazil (Aggarwal and Goldar, 2019). The significant decline in WFPR for females and for all persons in 2017-18 seems to be driven by a significant fall in the rural figures for both males and females, possibly due to a lack of proper employment opportunities, especially in agriculture and related activities. Other reasons for a decline in women's participation in the labor market also include social restrictions on women's participation in the labor force, discrimination at workplaces in terms of wages (Srivastava & Srivastava, 2010), difficulties in getting regular jobs (Goldar & Aggarwal, 2015), and the absence of ample job opportunities for women (Thomas, 2015) who are heavily employed in the informal sector without any legal protection. The withdrawal of rural women from the labor force is also prompted by a decline in poverty (Ghose, 2016; Mehrotra and Sinha, 2017), and increased migration by men of the households to urban areas in search of jobs that puts family responsibility of childcare and elder care on women. There is thus a great potential to increase the female WFPR in India by providing employment opportunities in the non-agriculture sectors where, however, the gender disparity is even higher. Policy interventions are therefore necessary to bring about parity. This could happen if improvements are made in women\u2019s access to quality education, suitable training and skill development, improved access to childcare and elder care, improved maternity protection for balancing work-life responsibilities, parental leave, increased job-flexibility, public safety and improved safe and accessible public transport, encouragement to women friendly policies in the private sector, and an awareness about the importance of work by women to their family. These all are to be part of a coordinated policy framework which promotes a pattern of growth that creates job opportunities for women (Aggarwal and Goldar, 2019). The efforts to increase the women WFPR are also imperative so that a sufficient supply of labor is adequately available to meet the growing demand due to a sustained growth in GDP."

    "output": "Generally, the \u2018informal\u2019 activities lack social protection and insurance; have low productivity and low wages; have small -sized enterprises; and are a small contributor to the national exchequer because most of these are out of the tax net.\nWith a high share of the employment in the casual and self -employment categories (76.2 percent in 2018), one may infer that the quality of employment in India is still very poor, though there has been a slight improvement in recent years due to an increase in the share of regular employment from 15 percent in 1999 to 23.8 percent in 2018 (Ghose and Kumar, 2021, Table 8). Based on an employment quality index, Ghose and Kumar (2021, p14) also present evidence of a steady improvement in the average quality of employment during 1999 -2018, aided by a decline of employment share of the casual labour, and an increase in the employment share of the regular and salary employees."

    "output": "From 1981-2017, the growth in employment took place at an average rate of just 1.33 per cent per annum. The share of agriculture sector, which still retains the largest share of employment, has been a laggard with almost zero per cent growth. Among the other broad sectors, growth is driven mainly by the construction sector and the services sector where the average annual growth in employment has been 6 and 3.2 per cent respectively.  Within the service sector, it is the market services which have consistently grown faster than the non-market services.\n\nHowever, the growth in employment has not been uniform across all the sub-periods. Employment growth in agriculture was the highest in the pre -reform period of 1980 -93 as the sector was then the major source of employment in the country. Howe ver, with the opening up of the economy, opportunities opened up in both manufacturing and in the services sector. As a result, job growth in agriculture decelerated after 1993 and in fact, employment declined in absolute numbers leading to a negative employment growth during the sub-periods 2003-07 and 2008-17.\n\nSpecifically, the 2008-17 sub-period brought a substantive slowdown to the pace of employment growth in manufacturing, attributed to the impact of the global financial crisis (GFC), increasing international competitiveness, and the emergence of strong global value chains (GVC). Employment in services grew at a rate of 3.2 per cent during 1981-2017, but the growth has gradually decelerated since 2003. The deceleration is faster for market services than non-market services.  Growth in employment in the construction sector has been very high, especially during the sub-period of 2003-07 due to expansionary fiscal policy of the government, but some slowdown was experienced after the GFC.\n\nThe overall employment situation has been worsening since 2003, with a deceleration in employment growth. Ghose and Kumar (2021) finds that the deceleration is more for the less -educated (educated only up to primary), indicating a \u2018skill -biased\u2019 technological change in the process of production. Post -1999, they find evidence of rapidly declining employment opportunities for less educated workers in both agriculture and non -agriculture sectors.\n\nHere is a summary of the growth rates of employment in broad sectors:\nAgriculture, Hunting, Forestry and Fishing:\n1981-93: 1.44%\n1994-2002: 0.52%\n2003-07: -0.48%\n2008-17: -2.17%\n1981-2017: -0.02%\nMining and Quarrying:\n1981-93: 4.27%\n1994-2002: 0.15%\n2003-07: -0.12%\n2008-17: -2.83%\n1981-2017: 0.76%\nManufacturing:\n1981-93: 2.05%\n1994-2002: 2.41%\n2003-07: 1.99%\n2008-17: 0.04%\n1981-2017: 1.59%\nElectricity, Gas and Water Supply:\n1981-93: 2.58%\n1994-2002: 0.99%\n2003-07: 2.98%\n2008-17: 3.93%\n1981-2017: 2.61%\nConstruction:\n1981-93: 6.99%\n1994-2002: 4.86%\n2003-07: 8.57%\n2008-17: 4.78%\n1981-2017: 6.09%\nServices:\n1981-93: 3.73%\n1994-2002: 3.52%\n2003-07: 3.00%\n2008-17: 2.34%\n1981-2017: 3.20%\nMarket Services:\n1981-93: 4.39%\n1994-2002: 4.35%\n2003-07: 3.38%\n2008-17: 2.50%\n1981-2017: 3.74%\nNon-Market Services:\n1981-93: 2.88%\n1994-2002: 2.20%\n2003-07: 2.33%\n2008-17: 2.02%\n1981-2017: 2.41%\nTotal economy:\n1981-93: 2.11%\n1994-2002: 1.60%\n2003-07: 1.27%\n2008-17: 0.12%\n1981-2017: 1.33%"

    "output": "The trends in employment growth in the 27 India KLEMS industries during the period 1980-2017 are as follows: The growth in persons employed for the entire period, 1981-2017, along with four sub-periods 1981-1993, 1994-2002, 2003-2007, and 2008-2017 are depicted in Table 4.4, while Figure 4.1 provides a ranking of the industries according to employment growth for the entire period 1981-2017. From the Table 4.4, we observe that the growth rate of employment varies significantly across industries reflecting a change in the speed at which jobs are created in different sectors during the period. Employment has shifted from farm to the non-farm sector, particularly towards construction and some non-market services such as trade, transport, business and financial services. For the full period of 1980-2017, total employment has increased from 283.6 million to 464.7 million with an average annual growth rate of 1.33 per cent. Meanwhile, agriculture and mining & quarrying, which together employed the largest share of 42.7 per cent of the total employment in 2017, experienced a stagnant growth in employment with almost no annual growth in agriculture and a modest growth of 0.76 per cent in mining. In fact, the agriculture sector employed 1.5 million less persons in 2017 as compared with 1980, and the mining sector provided jobs to only 4.8 lacs extra persons over the 38-year period. Among the 13 KLEMS industries withing manufacturing, very few industries show fast trend growth in employment. As a result, though manufacturing added 24 million jobs between 1980 and 2017, its share in total employment remained relatively stagnant between 10.5 -11.5 per cent during the period. Within manufacturing, the industries which have grown at a fast rate, more than 4 per cent per annum, are electrical and optical equipment; machinery, nec; rubber and plastic products; and coke, refined petroleum products (Figure 4.1). At the other extreme, there are industries, mostly the traditional labour -intensive manufacturing industries, where employment growth has been quite slow (at less than 2 per cent) i.e., textiles and leather products; wood and products of wood; food products; other non -metallic mineral products; chemicals; etc. If we wish to increase the share of manufacturing in total employment then some of the slow-growing sectors need policy initiatives and incentives to promote them. Construction is one important sector that has consistently experienced fast employment growth at an average of 6 per cent over the entire period, adding 48 million jobs, which is more than one-fourth of all new jobs added during the period. Though construction has low labour productivity, it has absorbed a major proportion of the displaced labour from agriculture. It now contributes 11.6 per cent to total employment in 2017 as compared with just 2 per cent in 1980. Ghose and Kumar (2021, p. 22) found evidence of rapid technological advances and rising capital intensity in the manufacturing and services sectors. It seems that the 2008 global financial crisis considerably slowed employment growth in the Indian economy because of the domestic and spill over effects of slowdowns observed in many other globally integrated economies.  Further discussion on employment growth in India especially in the 2011-2017 period based on an econometric analysis is presented in Annexure 4B."

    "output": "From 1980 to 2017, growth in employment in the construction sector, which has a large share of casual labor, initially accelerated due to expanding government programs such as rural employment guarantee schemes, rural housing schemes, and rural roads schemes. However, these programs did not progress much between 2011 and 2018. Despite this, construction still has vast employment potential.\n\nMost service sub-sectors, except public administration, grew at more than 3 per cent during the 38-year period, resulting in the addition of 109 million jobs, 77 million of which were from market services alone. Trade added the maximum number of jobs at 34 million, while transport and storage added 17 million, 'other services' added 14 million, education added 13 million, and business services added 12 million. The service sector thereby contributed 60 per cent to the total additional employment between 1980 and 2017. All activities in the services sector such as trade; hotels; transport; post & telecommunication; financial services; education; and health have registered fast employment growth. Most of this growth can be credited to liberalization and opening up of the sector after the economic reforms were initiated in 1991. However, attention needs to be paid to further tap the employment potential in the services sector, in order to absorb the shift of labor from agriculture.\n\nWhile total employment grew at a substantial rate of 2.1 per cent and 1.6 per cent in the first two sub-periods of 1981-93 and 1994-2002, the rate of growth declined after 2002, ending up in an absolute decline in employment of 8 million persons between 2011-12 and 2017-18. In fact, deceleration in the growth in employment could be seen even during the earlier NSS-EUS rounds between 1999-2004 and 2004-11. Agriculture and mining also have a negative average employment growth of -1.6 and -1.9 per cent respectively during 2003 to 2017, due to an absolute decline in employment of 57 million in agriculture and 0.6 million in mining. Consequently, their share in total employment has reduced significantly from 58 per cent in 2003 to just 43 per cent in 2017. The deceleration in growth in employment after 2002 is also experienced by many other industries across both, manufacturing and the services sector. Notable among these are: Food products, textiles, wood products, paper products, chemicals, basic metals, trade, hotels, transport, post and telecommunication, public admin., and education. We thus find a widespread phenomenon of falling employment growth."

    "output": "India experienced a severe slowing of growth in employment after the global financial crisis (GFC) of 2008, with the average annual growth rate for employment falling from 1.3 per cent for the period 2003-07, to just 0.6 per cent for 2008-17. Several explanations have been provided for the low employment growth in India, which include low work-force participation rates (WFPR), low labour intensity in several sectors, rigid labour laws, increased use of capital- intensive technology, rapid advancements in technology, low employment elasticity, decline in poverty of the households that induces women not to work in low-productive jobs and non-availability of suitable jobs. Most sectors have registered a decline in the rate of employment growth since the global financial crisis of 2008. The industries of coke, refined petroleum products and nuclear fuel, machinery, nec., electrical and optical equipment, are the few exceptions that have experienced a real surge in employment growth."

    "output": "Several manufacturing industries could accelerate the growth of output and employment in India through integration with the global value chains. These include auto-vehicles and vehicle components, capital goods, pharma, chemicals, agriculture and food, metals, textiles and apparel, leather and rubber, renewable energy, etc. A meaningful employment policy thus has to be designed which can understand the dynamics of the employment potential of each industry and take necessary sector specific measures to tap their potential. India has to identify the strongest growing industries of the economy, both in manufacturing and modern services and also the skills that are in demand. Skill enhancement and required training for the acquisition of these skills should be the focus of the educational and employment programmes. Since India has not invested enough in the human infrastructure to reap the benefit of its demographic transition, investment in human and physical infrastructure will need to be scaled up to promote entrepreneurship and create jobs. The next generation of economic reforms necessary to promote and maintain international competitiveness must also be undertaken at the earliest so as to reap the benefits of GVC and the integration of the different economies."

    "output": "From 1981 to 2017, the index of labour quality in India increased at an annual growth rate of 1.2 per cent, which is marginally slower than the growth in employment at 1.3 per cent. This indicates that the growth in labour quality index is almost as important as the growth in employment for growth in labour input. The growth in labour quality index has been relatively fast in mining and manufacturing sectors and has been slow in agriculture and construction sectors. Growth in the index has been moderate for the services sector at an average of 0.9 per cent per year, but the growth rate, as expected, is slightly higher in market services as compared with non-market services, reflecting the skill requirements and the nature of activity of the sectors. Since the growth in labour quality is affected by both the changes in the skill composition (education) and the growth in labour compensation (wages paid to labour), there are hardly any significant changes in the skill composition of the labour who works in agriculture and construction. Growth in labour quality index in most of the broad sectors has been faster in the sub-period 2003-07 as compared with the period 2008-17, possibly due to faster growth in wages during this sub-period."

Regarding the 27 KLEMS industries, the growth in labor quality index over 1981-2017 has wide variations both between industries and also over time within the same industry. While the agriculture sector observed an annual growth of only 0.3 per cent, mining experienced among the highest annual rates of growth of 1.32 per cent across all 27 industries. Within the manufacturing sector, eight out of 13 industries have grown at a rate of 0.7 per cent or higher, e.g., food products, paper products, chemicals, rubber, machinery, transport, while the remaining five have shown a lower growth rate. While the labour quality index in the utility industry grew at an average rate of 0.7 per cent per annum, the growth has been much slower in the construction industry mainly due to the predominance of the low-skilled labour in the construction industry\u2014that is mostly casual labour without any job security, earning very low wages, often even below the statutory minimum wage rates. The industries within the services sector did not experience the similar wide variation in the growth of index of labour quality, mainly because of the similar nature of the skills - mainly medium to high -skill, of the person employed in these industries. On one extreme of the variation, we have \u2018other\u2019 services and health with more than or equal to 0.7 per cent annual growth, and on the other extreme the industries of \u2018business\u2019 services and financial services observed an annual growth of around 0.4 per cent in labour quality index. On the whole, not only skill quality of each industry is different, but it has changed differently over the whole period and during the sub -periods and there is no discernible common pattern during the four sub-periods."

It is observed that the growth rates of labour input are higher than those of persons employed because of the contribution of the labour quality index, but the trend in growth in labour input is similar to that of the growth in employment. The construction sector has shown the fastest growth in labor input, followed by the services sector, induced by acceleration in the market services, and the electricity sector (Table 4.7)."

    "input": "Question: What is the definition, importance, and trend analysis of labor income share in the context of growth accounting and income distribution?",
    "output": "The distribution of income between capital, labor, and intermediate inputs is an important element in growth accounting because income shares, under conditions of competitive markets, can be used to measure the contributions that each factor makes towards output growth. So, measurement of labor income share plays an important role in the growth accounting framework to compute total factor productivity (TFP). In production analysis, with only two factors of production -- labor and capital, the labor income share is defined as the ratio of labor income to gross value added (GVA). Then, under the assumption of constant returns to scale, the sum of the labor income share and the capital income share is equal to one and the capital income share can be obtained as the residual of one minus the labor income share.\nThe importance of labor income share also lies in understanding the changes in the distribution of national income. A downward trend in the labor income share is an indication that a higher share of national income is going to the capital, thus implying an unequal distribution of national income. However, it is to be noted that since labor income share (S L) is inversely related to labor productivity (LP) (equation 4.3); therefore, its distribution would also help in explaining the pattern of labor productivity. So, if product wage rises faster than labor productivity, the labor income share increases. If they move in tandem, the labor income share remains unchanged. Thus, unless the growth in product wages (nominal wages deflated by price index of output) is faster than the growth in labor productivity, the growth in labor income share is bound to be negative.\nBy definition, labor income share (SL) is calculated as follows:\nSL = (W.L) / (P.V) which can also be expressed as SL= (W/P) / (V/L) or SL= Product Wage/ Labour productivity, where labour productivity=V/L, V=Gross value added, L= Employment, W= Nominal wage rate of labour, P= Price of output.\nThe trend in labor income share for the broad sectors of the Indian economy are presented in Table 4.8. While labor income share for each industry is obtained directly from equation 4.1; that for each sector can be defined as the weighted average of each industry\u2019s labor income share (equation 4.4). The weight for each industry is the share of the industry\u2019s value added in the total value added of the sector. Therefore, the trend of total labor income share in a sector (or in the economy) can be decomposed by the change in the labor income share within each industry over the period and the change in value added share of each industry within the sector (or economy). Thus, Sst =  \u2211\ud835\udc60 \ud835\udc56=1 vitSit"

    "output": "Sst and Sit are the labour income share in sector \u2018s\u2019 and industry \u2018i\u2019 at period t and v it is the share of value added in the ith industry at period t. From Table 4.8 it is clear that the total economy and all the broad sectors have a long -term tendency of a declining trend in labour income share. A closer analysis reveals that in 1980, the labour income share varied from a maximum of 79 per cent in construction to the minimum of 35 per cent in electricity, followed by manufacturing, at 39 per cent and services and agriculture at around 57 per cent each. The non -market services had a higher labour income share, at 61 per cent as compared to 52 per cent for the market services sector. However, by 2017, labour income shares of the total economy and of the services sector had each declined by around four percentage points because of a change in the structure of the economy, by more than half in mining and by eight percentage points in manufacturing. The decline in the labour income share has been sharper for market services, by more than 11 percentage points, as compared to non-market services, which witnessed a decline of just one percentage point. An inter-temporal comparison shows that between 1980 and 2003, the labour income share has declined in the intermediate years for the all the broad sectors and the total economy except the construction sector where it is almost stagnant at around 79 per cent. After 2003, while there is a continuous decline in the share for mining and construction, there was a marginal increase in labour income share for manufacturing and services --both market and non-market. But the share has remained stagnant for agriculture. Though an increase in labour income share of 2.6 percentage points is observed in the total economy between 2008 and 2017, the figure for 2017-18 is still lower than that what it was in 1980 -81. The increase between 2008 and 2017 seems to have been induced by an increase in the share for the manufacturing and services sectors. One of the likely reasons for this is the fast increase in real product wages in manufacturing and market services during this period (Table 4.12). Much attention has been paid lately to the falling labour income share in many countries across the world. Dao et al. (2017), point out that there has been a downward trend in labour share in global income since the early 1990s and this downward trend is observed for advanced economies as well as emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs). For India, a decline in the labour income share in manufacturing has been found by a few scholars (Goldar and Aggarwal, 2005; Goldar, 2013; Abraham and Sasikumar, 2017; Goldar, 2022)."

    "input": "Question: How is the volatility of the labor income share evaluated, and what do the results indicate about the absolute and relative stability of labor income share in India from 1980 to 2017?",
    "output": "Based on the notion of constant labour income share, Solow (1958) proposed two ways to evaluate the stability of the labour income share: absolute stability, which examines the changing extent of total labour income share (expressed by serial variance) in a certain time span, and relative stability, which requires that the variance of total labour income share should be less than the variance in each sector or industry (Zhou, 2016, p.68). Absolute stability results for the Indian economy during 1980 to 2017 (Table 4.9) do not satisfy the condition of absolute stability, showing that the volatility value for the combined period lies outside the volatility values for the sub-periods. Relative stability results (Table 4.10) show that the condition of relative stability is satisfied as the volatility of the labour income share for the total economy is generally lower than \u2018within\u2019 sector volatility, except agriculture.  These results together show that although the labour income share in each sector has a relatively larger change, the change of total labour income share can be relatively stable due to the sectoral structure change, but the stability is missing over time."

    "input": "Question: How can the change in the labour income share be explained, and what are the three effects into which the total change is decomposed?",
    "output": "The change in the labour income share can be explained either by a change in the labour income share of each industry or by the change in the value-added share (i.e., a structural change) or by change in both the components. The total change is decomposed into three effects: the \u2018within\u2019 industry effect; the \u2018structural change\u2019 effect (\u2018between\u2019 effect) and the \u2018covariance\u2019 effect. The equation used for the KLEMS 27 industries is: \u2206St=St - St-1 = \u2211I vi,t \u2206Si,t + \u2211\u2206vi,t Si,t + \u2211\u2206vi,t \u2206Si,t, where \u2206 is change, St is the labour income share in period t and Si,t is the labour income share in industry \u2018i\u2019 at period t and vi,t is the share of value added in the ith industry at period t. The changes in labour income share over the period 1981-2017 have not been uniform, with a general decline of 0.12 percentage points per year over the entire period. The decline in wage share is observed for the first three sub-periods and is relatively large in the sub-period of 2003 to 2007, but the share increased in the fourth sub-period, 2008-2017. For the entire period of 1981-2017 and the first three sub-periods, both within and between industry effects are responsible for the decline in the wage share, but the within industry effect is greater than the structural effect. In the period of post-GFC, 2008-17, both effects have contributed to the increase in wage share. The stronger within-industry effect than the between-industry effect to explain the change in aggregate labour income share is also supported by Abraham and Sasikumar (2017) for Indian organized manufacturing sector, and OECD (2012) for 26 OECD countries and 20 industries in the private sector since 1990."

Another feature is the decline in the level of real product wages in the sub-period 1980-93 in both mining and construction, resulting in a negative average growth rate during 1981-93 and also an overall negative average growth rate for the entire period 1981-2017 for the construction sector, and only a small positive increase in the mining sector.

    "output": "The main findings of the chapter are as follows: (a) The overall WFPR in India has been falling, especially for rural females; (b) There has been a significant change in the structure of employment in the Indian economy between 1980 and 2017, with the share of agriculture reducing from 70 per cent to 42 per cent and the share of services doubling from 17 per cent to 34 per cent, mainly service-led; (c) The growth in employment has slowed down considerably recently, with an absolute decline of 8 million employed persons between 2011-12 and 2017-18 and a significant increase in the unemployment rate during the same period. The employment level declined between 2011 and 2017 in agriculture, mining, as well as in manufacturing and while employment growth has been driven mainly by construction and the services sectors, especially market services, this growth has also slowed; (d) A change is noticed in the education profile of the work force as the proportion of more-educated workers has significantly increased; (e) Along with overall growth in employment, there has been a significant growth, at 1.2 per cent per annum, in the labour quality index leading to a faster growth in labour input during 1981-2017. Growth in employment and growth in labour quality index have not been uniform, with considerable variations being observed across industries and across sub-periods in both; (f) Though there is a long-term trend of a fall in labour income share for the economy, no unique trend could be discerned at the broad sector level. The change in labour income share seems to have occurred mainly due to \u2018within industry\u2019 effect in the sectors and \u2018within industry\u2019 effect is larger as compared with the structural change effect. Real product wages have experienced a consistent increase, with an annual average growth rate of four per cent for the period of 1981-2017. India\u2019s employment situation has been quite precarious with an absolute decline in total employment and shooting unemployment rates between 2011-17. With a fall in employment elasticity from 0.3-0.4 in 1999 to 0.1 - 0.2 in 2017, unless India achieves a growth rate 8-9 per cent in real GDP that is job-rich, it will not be able to meet the challenge of providing employment to the backlog and the additions to labour force. Rather than a macro approach, the key to policymaking appears to lie in a focus on sectoral understanding and microeconomics."

    "output": "Annexure 4B analyzes the trends in employment in India during the period 2011-2017, assessing the impact of growth in real wages. Aggregate employment growth from 2008-2017 was lower compared to 1981-1993, 1994-2002, and 2003-2007. There was a decline in employment in agriculture, allied activities, mining, and quarrying. Manufacturing employment was almost stagnant during 2008-2017, contrasting with the higher growth rates in previous periods. Between 2011 and 2017, manufacturing saw an absolute fall in employment. Aggregate employment decreased, with the agriculture and allied sector experiencing a loss of approximately 29 million jobs. Construction employment increased by about 5 million, partially offset by a 2 million job loss in manufacturing. The decline in agricultural employment was largely compensated by a 20 million increase in services employment between 2011 and 2012. Overall, total employment in the Indian economy fell by about 7 million between 2011 and 2017. An econometric analysis, using an ARDL model and time series data from 1980-2011, was conducted to further examine these trends, predicting employment for 2012-2017. The economy was divided into agriculture and allied, construction, industry (excluding construction), and services sectors for the analysis. The estimated long-run coefficients of the employment function, presented in Table 4B.1, indicate a negative effect of real wages on employment, particularly in agriculture, and a positive effect of real GVA growth on employment across all four sectors."

    "output": "Table 4B.1 presents the ARDL Model Results, long-run coefficients, and employment function, with the dependent variable being ln (employment). The explanatory variables and their coefficients are as follows:\n\n*   **Agriculture and allied:** ln real wage rate: -0.98 (-5.1), ln real GVA: 0.89 (7.36)\n*   **Construction:** ln real wage rate: -0.52(-2.73), ln real GVA: 0.91(33.97)\n*   **Industry excluding construction:** ln real wage rate: -0.29(-2.16), ln real GVA: 0.19(2.57), lCT intensity (economy): 23.47(2.72)\n*   **Services:** ln real wage rate: -0.20(-1.94), ln real GVA: 0.60(17.51), lCT intensity (economy): -4.69(-2.20)\n\nThe period analyzed is 1980-2011 for agriculture and allied, as well as construction, and 1990-2011 for industry excluding construction and services. R-squared values are very high (around 0.999), indicating a good fit. There is need for caution in the interpretation of the coefficient of the ICT intensity variable because it is highly correlated with the trend term, and may thus pick up the trend effect, i.e., it might be picking up the effects of technological change and other such developments taking place in the economy over time, along with the effect of ICT capital on employment. Yet, based on the results obtained, it would perhaps not be wrong to claim that there is some indication that investment in ICT had a negative effect on employment generation in the services sector. No such negative effect is found for the industry sector (excluding construction). Rather, ICT investments made in the economy seem to have helped in job creation in manufacturing.\nAs mentioned above, the models for explaining employment level have been estimated for the period up to 2011 with the objective of predicting employment for subsequent years and then assessing how well the actual employment during 2012-2017 compares with that predicted by the model. This is depicted in Figure 4B.1.\nThe estimated models for different segments of the economy predict a fall in aggregate employment between 2011 and 2017, which matches in terms of direction with the data on actual employment although the data for the recent period has not been used in the process of model estimation. The fact that the actual employment for 2017 is fairly close to that predicted by the model implies the observed fall in employment between 2011 and 2017 is attributable mostly to the changes that have taken place in the explanatory variables used in the models. Arguably, hikes in real wages have played a role in causing a fall in employment at the aggregate level."

    "input": "Question: What factors contributed to employment changes in different sectors of the Indian economy between 2011 and 2017, and how do model-based estimates compare to actual employment figures?",
    "output": "Turning now to the estimates for the four segments of the economy (see Fig. 4B.2), in the industry sector (excluding construction), the average growth rate in real wages was 5.4 percent per annum during 2003-2011 which increased to 8.2 percent per annum during 2012 -2017. The fact that there has been a fall in employment in this sector between 2011 and 2017 appears to be explainable mostly by this factor. By contrast, in the agriculture and allied sector, there has been only a moderate increase in the growth rate of real wages, up from 5.1 percent per annum during 2003-2011 to 5.6 percent per annum during 2012-2017. The fall in employment that took place in this sector between 2011 and 2017 thus cannot be attributed only or mostly to increase in the growth rate in real wages. The explanation lies elsewhere too. Another important factor that seems to have played a role is the fall in the growth rate in real GVA \u2013 it fell from 3.9 percent per annum during 2003 -2011 to 3.1 percent per annum during 2012-2017.\n\nIt is interesting to observe that the fall in aggregate employment in the Indian economy between 2011 and 2017 has been smaller than that predicted by employment estimates generated by the model. According to the model -based estimates, employment should have decreased by about 13 million whereas the actual fall was by about 7 million. The source of this difference lies primarily in the industry sector. Going by the employment estimates based on the estimated model, employment in industry (excluding construction) should have decreased by about 7.2 million between 2011 and 2017 \u2013 the actual fall was much lower at 2.4 million. It appears that the negative effect of an acceleration in the growth rate in real wages in manufacturing during 2012-2017 was offset to a considerable extent by certain other developments in the manufacturing sector."

    "output": "Using data up to 2004 (EUS 61st round) to predict employment for 2011 (EUS 68th round) and 2018 (PLFS -I), the predicted values closely match the actual, demonstrating the robustness of the methodology. For 2004-2011, the model correctly predicts a fall in agricultural employment and a rise in other sectors and aggregate employment. For 2011-2018, it accurately predicts a decline in agriculture and industry (excluding construction), along with an increase in construction and services.  The predictions based on models estimated up to 2004 (estimate-2) and 2011 (estimate-1) are close to each other and to actual employment.

    "input": "Question: How does the analysis presented relate to the comparability of employment series used in the report, particularly regarding the use of PLFS and EUS 68th round data?",
    "output": "The analysis presented has a bearing on an issue concerning the employment series used for the analysis presented in the report. This is the issue of data comparability since in the process of construction of the employment series for the years beyond 2011 the employment estimates based on PLFS have been used in conjunction with the estimates based on EUS 68th round. The trends in employment in the 2010s indicated by the PLFS in combination with the EUS 68th round for 2011 are quite different, in several respects, from the trends for the 1990s and 2000s revealed by EUS of 2011 along with that for earlier years. Thus, a fall is seen in aggregate employment between 2011 and 2017, and such a fall has occurred in the agriculture and allied sector and in manufacturing. While a fall in employment in agriculture had occurred also between 2004 and 2011, a fall in employment in manufacturing between successive employment surveys did not occur in the employment estimates of earlier rounds of EUS. The fact that manufacturing achieved a relatively high average annual growth rate in real GVA of about 7.2 percent during 2012-2017 whereas employment in manufacturing decline at the rate of (-)0.7 percent per annum (a fall by about 2.3 million persons) in this period appears puzzling, and contrary to expectations. A negative employment elasticity in manufacturing over a period of seven year has not occurred for Indian manufacturing ever in the period 1980 -2011 going by India KLEMS data (perhaps true also for the 1970s, 1960s and 1950s). As regards the fall in employment in agriculture, this is not unrealistic or altogether unexpected, and it should be treated as a mark of the achievements made in terms of structural transformation in the development process in India. While the growth rate of employment in construction during 2012-2017 is positive at 1.6 percent per annum, it has fallen sharply from the growth rate of about 9 percent per annum achieved during 2005-2011. Another interesting difference between the survey findings of PLFS and those of EUS 68th (for 2011) is that the unemployment rate was 2.2"

    "output": "Based on the studies that have been undertaken on the recent trends in the employment situation in India using PLFS data in conjunction with EUS 68 th round data, some key points that emerge are: (1) The rate of unemployment is relatively high (6.1 percent in 2017 and 5.8 percent in 2018), and still higher among the youth, with 17.8 percent unemployment among persons of age 15-29 years in 2017 (up from 6.1 percent in 2011). (2) There has been a significant fall in women work participation rate in rural areas, from 37 percent in 2011 to 25.5 percent in 2017. Among women of age 15 -29 years in rural areas, the work participation rate has fallen from 41 percent in 2004 to 26 percent in 2011 and then to 14 percent in 2017. (3) The labour force participation rate among youth bore a negative correlation with the economic status of the household in 2011, but this has changed to a mild positive correlation in 2017. The labor force participation rate in the lowest quintile has come down from 48 percent in 2011 to 38 percent in 2017, indicating that youth in rural areas belonging to relatively poorer households are now less inclined and less under compulsion to join labor force than was the situation in 2011."

    "output": "A much more important point to note regarding the trends in employment in India in the recent period is that the employment in manufacturing has fallen, and thus manufacturing has not been able to absorb the workers that moved out of agriculture. The analysis presented later in Chapter 8 of the Report brings out that the growth rate in employment in the formal segment of manufacturing had fallen from 4.8 percent per annum during 2000-2007 to 1.1 percent per annum during 2008-2017. In the informal segment, the growth rates in employment were 1.6 percent per annum during 2000-2007 and it came down to (-)0.5 percent per annum during 2008-2017. Evidently, the fall in employment in manufacturing in the recent period is traceable to the failure of the informal manufacturing sector in sufficiently enhancing job opportunities."

    "output": "Chapter 5 analyzes the trends in physical capital in Indian industries during the period 1980-81 to 2017-18. Specifically, it examines the trends in investment/GDP ratio, real investment, capital stock, and growth rates of capital services at the industry level. All the data used in the analysis are based on India KLEMS dataset version 2019 (hereafter IKD -2019). The analysis in this Chapter is primarily confined to broad sectors of the economy, while more detailed tables are provided in the annexure. The analysis covers the period 1980-81 to 2017-18, subdivided into three sub-periods, 1980-81 to 1993-94, 1994-95 to 2002-03, and 2003-04 to 2017-18. The methodology used to construct the capital service growth rates is based on Jorgenson (1967) and Christensen and Jorgenson (1969). This approach, rooted in neoclassical theory, requires detailed asset-wise data on investment, investment prices, rate of return of capital, and the user cost (or rental prices) of capital for the 27 KLEMS industries. All the final estimates of gross capital formation (referred to as investment throughout this paper) are consistent with the National Accounts Statistics (NAS) with base year 2011-12, and several imputations have been made to generate consistent series of capital input for individual industries and assets. For this purpose, the annual survey of industries (ASI) for the formal manufacturing sector and National Sample Survey (NSS) for the unorganised manufacturing sector have been relied upon. Detailed asset-industry data on GFCF from NAS, which are not usually published, has also been obtained. The aggregate capital services growth rates are measured using estimates of asset-specific capital stocks and user costs (or rental prices) for three individual assets: construction, machinery, and transport equipment. Rental prices or the user costs of these individual assets are calculated using distinct asset prices and depreciation rates, for each of the 27 KLEMS industries, which includes 13 manufacturing industries and 14 non-manufacturing industries."

It also observes an increasing role of equipment capital (i.e., machinery and transport equipment) in the Indian economy, which helps improve capital composition effects. Capital services growth rates are mostly higher than capital stock growth rates across the board, and much of the recent expansion in capital services and capital deepening is in the market services sector.  The chapter is organized into five sections that cover the composition and growth in real investment across broad sectors, the distribution of investment across sectors by equipment and non-equipment assets, the changing composition and growth rate of estimated capital stock, the capital service growth rates, and the composition effects."

    "output": "In the 1990s and 2000s, the manufacturing sector maintained an edge over other sectors in terms of equipment investment. The market services sector and utility industry also had high equipment share, whereas agriculture, mining, and construction industries contributed relatively less. In the case of non-equipment, non-market services constituted the highest portion of the investment, occupying more than 40 per cent of all construction investment in the economy. Although manufacturing had about 16 per cent in the 1980s and 1990s, its share fell to 12 per cent in the 2000s, which was somewhat captured by market services that improved from 14 per cent in the 1980s to 27 per cent in the 2000s. Agriculture nearly halved its relative presence in construction investment from 19 per cent in the 1980s to 10 per cent in the 2000s.\n\nHowever, the investment to GDP ratio measured in real terms was the highest in the utility industry, which is not unexpected, given the high capital intensity in the energy sector. Among the other sectors, the highest investment to GDP ratio was in the non-market services, which includes the government sector. Agriculture and construction industries had the lowest investment intensity. This pattern holds across the three time periods. However, investment intensity increased in all the sectors in the 2000s compared with the 1990s, except manufacturing. The highest increase in the non-utility sectors was in construction, followed by non-market services. Agriculture also saw an increase, in fact, a consistent increase from the 1980s to the 1990s and further in the 2000s. On the other hand, the investment/GDP ratio in manufacturing, after a remarkable rise in the 1990s, dropped marginally in the 2000s. In fact, in the 1990s, investment intensity fell substantially in mining, utilities, and market services. Simultaneously, it improved in manufacturing, non-market services, and construction, leading to a nearly stable overall investment/GDP ratio. In the 2000s, with the substantial increase in the utilities and most sectors except for manufacturing, the overall investment intensity improved."

    "output": "The growth rate of real investment for the broad sectors are plotted in Figures 5.4 to 5.6. These are the growth rates of simple additions of individual industry investments and are not weighted growth rates. Figure 5.4 shows the growth rate of total investment across all assets, and in Figures 5.5 and 5.6, we divide the total investment into equipment and non -equipment assets, respectively.\n\nReal investment growth was the highest in the aggregate economy during the 2003-18 period, driven by faster growth in equipment investment. During the other two sub-periods, the aggregate investment growth hovered around 5 to 6 per cent, whereas it was about 8 per cent during the 2000s.\n\nAggregate economy real investment growth was 5.3 per cent in the 1980s, with investment growing between 5 and 7 per cent on average in mining, manufacturing, utilities, and services \u2014both market and non-market. It was dismal at 1.3 per cent in agriculture, and moderate at 3.4 in construction. In the 1990s, investment growth improved in the economy, with construction and non -market services seeing a rapid rise from the previous period. While manufacturing still registered an impressive 5.5 per cent growth, it was lower than the previous period. In the 2000s, the agriculture sector, which had already improved its growth in the 1990s over the 1980s, further sustained a growth rate above 4.5 per cent. Among the other sectors, mining, construction, and market services grew at a substantial rate, although the construction sector saw an erosion in its growth rate from the previous period. Investment growth in manufacturing improved, registering an 8 per cent growth rate, while it fell in the non -market services sector.\n\nAmong the two asset categories, investment in construction grew at about 4 per cent in the economy in the 1980s, which increased to 8.5 per cent in the 1990s. The rise was primarily a result of a massive increase in construction and market services, but other sectors such as agriculture, manufacturing, and non -market services also showed an uptick. While the Indian economy seems to have seen a construction boom in the 1990s, the overall growth rate of construction investment fell to 5.4 per cent in the 2000s. So, while construction investment increased in all sectors in the 2000s, with the highest increase in construction, mining and quarrying, and market services, the rate of increase in most sectors was lower than in the 1990s."

However, the 2000s saw a significant boost with nearly 12 per cent growth, with equipment investment showing an even higher increase in general, and double-digit growth in most sectors. Agriculture was the only exception, but still experienced an impressive 8.5 per cent growth rate. Market services were the best performer among all the seven broad sectors in terms of equipment investment growth. While agriculture, manufacturing, and non-market services saw a growth rate of about 3-5 per cent, other sectors had a 7 to 9 per cent growth rate, resulting in overall growth of 5.4 per cent."

    "output": "The composition of aggregate capital stock in India over the last 37 years shows a clear shift from non-equipment capital to equipment capital. However, the overall capital stock in the economy is dominated by construction capital stock. For instance, the share of equipment capital stock increased from 15 per cent in 1980 to 32 per cent in 2017. Indeed, this has resulted in a drop of non-equipment share from 85 per cent to 68 per cent, yet close to 70 per cent of all capital stock in the economy consists of buildings and structures. Among the broad sectors of the economy, the highest share of equipment capital in the overall capital stock is in the mining sector. Among the non -mining sectors, manufacturing, utilities, and construction sectors maintain dominance over other sectors, and non-market services and agriculture are the ones with the lowest equipment capital stock among the broad sectors.

    "output": "The share of equipment in total capital stock increased over the years in all sectors of the economy, except for market services where it declined. The overall manufacturing sector clearly shows an increase in equipment share but a closer look at the disaggregated industry level suggests that the high equipment share is primarily in petroleum, paper, transport equipment, and food products industries. Many industries, such as textiles, non-metallic mineral products, and machinery, have seen a fall in equipment share.\n\nFigure 5.9 shows the annual growth rate of capital stock in each of the three assets in the aggregate economy, and in Figure 5.10, we have the average growth rate of total capital stock in each broad sector. As shown in Figure 5.9, growth in equipment capital was much more volatile compared with non-equipment and aggregate capital stock. In the 1980s through early 2000s, equipment capital grew somewhat stable, but after a drop in 2002-03, it accelerated substantively until the global financial crisis. Ever since then, it started falling, along with the construction capital stock. But again, during 2015-17 it shows more resilience. On the other hand, construction capital increased consistently until the global financial crisis and started falling since then."

The uptick in the total capital stock growth in the 2000s is supported by both assets, although much rapid improvement is seen in the equipment capital stock."

    "input": "Question: What are the key trends observed in aggregate capital service growth rates in the economy, and what factors contribute to these trends?",
    "output": "Aggregate capital service growth rates, divided into contributions from equipment assets and non-equipment assets, reveal several key trends. First, aggregate capital services in the economy have increased from about 5 per cent in the 1980s and 1990s to close to 8 per cent in the 2000s. Second, most of these increases in aggregate economy capital services come from construction and services sectors, with market services dominating the latter. The manufacturing sector has seen a somewhat stable growth rate of capital service over the entire period of analysis, although it was relatively better in the 1990s. These capital service growth rates are obtained as weighted growth rates of individual asset-specific capital stock, with user-cost as weights, and deploy an external rate of return based on the real interest rate. This approach differs from Jorgenson (1967) and Christensen and Jorgenson (1969), who use an internal rate of return derived from the capital income from the national accounts."

    "output": "According to the India KLEMS dataset 2019 version, Figure 5.11 illustrates the contribution of equipment and non-equipment assets to the aggregate capital service growth rate by sector. Looking at the contribution of the two asset types\u2014equipment, and non-equipment (construction), in absolute terms, the contribution of construction and building investment fell in the 1990s in agriculture, mining, manufacturing, and utility sectors. At the same time, it improved in the construction and services sectors (both market and non-market service). The volume of increases was much higher than the volume of declines, resulting in an overall improvement in the construction's contribution to capital services growth in the aggregate economy. In the 2000s, the contribution of construction capital to capital service growth rate further increased across the board, except in the manufacturing sector, where it fell marginally. The sum of the equipment and non-equipment contribution, which is the combined size of the two bars in Figure 5.11, is the aggregate capital service growth rate for the relevant industry."

    "output": "Table 5.1 presents the contribution of equipment and non-equipment assets to the aggregate capital service growth rate in the manufacturing sector. The table shows the contribution of equipment capital and non-equipment capital for various sub-sectors within manufacturing during the periods 1981-1993, 1994-2002, and 2003-2017. The note indicates that the sum of the equipment and non-equipment contribution is the aggregate capital service growth rate for the relevant industry. According to the India KLEMS dataset 2019 version, the contribution of equipment capital increased only in agriculture in both periods. Among the other sectors, it fell substantially in mining, utility, and market services, and slightly in non-market services in the 1990s, while it improved in the mining and manufacturing sectors. However, the improvement in manufacturing has been minor and was confined primarily to petroleum, chemicals, electrical & optical equipment, and transport equipment sectors. In all other sectors, it fell (Table 5.1). In the 2000s, construction and manufacturing saw declines in equipment capital service growth rate, while all other broad sectors saw improving contribution from equipment capital. The decline in manufacturing was modest, as the substantial fall."

    "input": "Question: What were the trends in the relative contributions of equipment and non-equipment capital to overall capital service growth across different sectors and time periods (1980s, 1990s, 2000s)?",
    "output": "In several sectors including petroleum, electrical & optical equipment, and non-metallic minerals, improvements in equipment capital contribution were somewhat offset by improvements in basic metals and machinery sectors (Table 5.1). In relative terms, in the 1980s, more than 80 per cent of the overall capital services growth in the agricultural sector and more than 60 per cent in the non-market services came from investments in new buildings. In the 1990s, although the relative importance of non-equipment capital fell in the agriculture sector, it still contributed more than 60 per cent of the sector's overall capital service growth rate. Simultaneously, the relative contribution of construction assets increased to above 80 per cent in the non-market services. Moreover, market services also joined this group, with almost 3/4th of its overall services coming from construction assets. The high relative contribution of construction in these three sectors led to more than half of the overall capital service growth in the entire economy being driven by construction investment accumulation. However, in the 2000s, construction investment's relative importance fell across the board except in the construction sector. Yet, the non-market services and agriculture maintained relatively high contributions from investment in buildings\u201450 to 65 per cent. Interestingly, in the 1980s, 60 per cent of overall capital service growth in the aggregate economy was driven by equipment capital accumulation. This originated primarily from mining, manufacturing, utilities, and construction, where 60 to 90 per cent of capital service growth was from equipment. However, the relative importance of equipment capital fell in the 1990s. Although it improved in the 2000s, it was still less than 60 per cent of the overall capital service growth rate observed in the 1980s. The drop in the 1990s and the improvement in the 2000s were both driven primarily by services. In relative terms, the contribution of equipment capital improved in the agriculture sector the most, from just 14 per cent of overall capital service growth in the 1980s to nearly 40 per cent in the 1990s. At the same time, it improved from 68 per cent to 74 per cent in manufacturing and fell everywhere else, with two services segments of the economy seeing rapid declines. Overall, with a substantial drop in equipment contributions in the market and non-market services, the contribution from equipment in the economy's capital service growth rate dropped to less than half in the 1990s. In the 2000s, however, the contribution of equipment capital relative to non-equipment increased, everywhere except in construction, with considerable improvement in utilities and services and marginal in other sectors. In the construction sector, the absolute contribution of equipment capital growth fell from 9.7 per cent to 8.3 per cent, while that of construction improved from 3.6 per cent to 4.4 per cent, thus lowering its relative importance and leading to a fall in the overall capital service growth in the sector."

    "input": "Question: What are the key trends and drivers of labor productivity in Indian industries, and how has the structure of the Indian economy transformed over time?",
    "output": "India\u2019s pattern of economic growth and subsequent structural changes during different policy regimes has been summarised in many studies (e.g., Krishna, 2015; Jha, 2015, Krishna, et al., 2017, Erumban, et. al., 2019). The GDP growth rate has been quite remarkable during the period 2001-2011 at 7.9 per cent as compared with 5.6 per cent during the earlier decade of 1991-2001 (Krishna, 2015). The acceleration of growth in the past two decades-1991-2011 has been attributed to, among others, substantial policy changes initiated in the early 1990s and that continued through the 2000s. The period of 2001 -11 has been defined as period of service-led growth in India by some economists (Ghose, 2015; Das, et al, 2015), as the industrial sector grew at 7.8 per cent whereas services registered an impressive annual average growth of 9.4 per cent. Consequently, this resulted in a structural transformation marked by a larger share of services sector in the overall GDP, and the several aspects of this structural transformation has been analysed in the literature (Kochhar et al, 2006; Islam, 2008; Papola and Sahu, 2012; Krishna, 2015; Chandrasekhar, 2015; Erumban et al., 2015, Krishna, et al., 2017). The primary sector\u2019s share in GDP 86 has declined to just 17.9 per cent in 201 7-18 (at 2011-12 prices) from 38.5 per cent in 1990 -91. The share of the services sector, on the other hand, has increased from 37.6 per cent to 53.9 per cent and the share of the secondary sector just increased from 24 per cent to 28.2 per cent, with the share of manufacturing increasing from 14.9 per cent to 18 per cent. Agriculture contributes only 15 per cent to GDP in 2017 and still employs 42 per cent of the workforce. This structural transformation has thus been from the primary to the tertiary sector, having bypassed the secondary sector. Simultaneously, there has also been a structural shift of the labour force from primary sector (where its share of employment declined from 64.6 per cent in 1990-91 to 42.3 per cent in 2017-18), to services (where the employment share increased from 20 per cent to 33.8 per cent during the same period). This kind of duality cannot happen unless there is a simultaneous structural change happening in the sphere of labour productivity. Such a structural change is part of the economic development process of developing economies that are characterised by large productivity gaps among their different sectors and industries. An economy\u2019s overall productivity depends not only on what\u2019s happening within industries, but also on the reallocation of resources across sectors. So, the structural change in labour productivity at the economy level will take place whenever there is reallocation of labour from low-productivity to high-productivity sectors.\nMeasuring labour productivity is important\u2014as the time profile of labour productivity not only reflects how productively labour is used to generate output but also the personal capacities of persons employed or the intensity of their effort. According to OECD (2008) \u2018labour productivity is a revealing indicator of several economic indicators as it offers a dynamic measure of economic growth, competitiveness, and living standards within an economy\u2019. It is in this context that the chapter has examined India\u2019s  labour productivity growth at the industry level to understand the proximate sources of growth in the Indian economy for the period 1980-2017.   We compute and analyse the estimates of labour productivity (LP) growth for each of the 27 industries, using the India KLEMS database."

    "output": "The chapter is organized as follows: Section 6.2 discusses the literature on labor productivity. Section 6.3 covers the methodology and dataset. Section 6.4 looks at trends in labor productivity for the 27 industries. Section 6.5 analyzes the sources of labor productivity and the \u2018virtuous\u2019 pattern of growth. Section 6.6 analyzes the results for the broad sectors of the economy and the sectoral decomposition for disaggregated industries. Section 6.7 covers a cross-country comparison of labor productivity, and Section 6.8 offers a conclusion.\n\nLabor productivity and its drivers are considered important because of their close links to GDP per capita. Productivity accurately measures the performance of an economy, an industry, and a firm in terms of the quantity and the efficiency with which inputs, especially labor, are used to produce goods and services. The efficiency of labor impacts the unit cost of production, affecting the competitiveness of the economy and its participation in global supply chains. Furthermore, growth in labor productivity helps in reducing poverty through its impact on long-term growth in per capita income. External shocks like the global financial crisis (GFC) or Covid-19 are likely to have a serious impact on labor productivity, resulting in loss in per capita income and an increase in poverty."

    "output": "Labor productivity reflects the volume of output produced per unit of labor input (OECD, 2016) and is described as one of the key indicators of economic performance and as an essential driver of change in living standards. However, it also depends on the use of other inputs, such as capital\u2014both physical and intangible; and technical and organizational change. OECD defines labor productivity as GDP per hour worked and its growth is measured in GDP at constant prices in the national currency of the country. Dieppe (ed. 2020) also pointed out that GDP per hour worked may be a better proposition to measure labor productivity, but for international comparisons, found it convenient to use output per worker because of wider availability of data for workers than hours. He, however, mentions doing this has the disadvantages of \u2018failure to account for the quality and intensity of labor input (pp. 15, Box 1)\u2019."

    "input": "Question: How is labor productivity measured at the industry and broad sector levels, and what factors contribute to its growth?",
    "output": "At the industry level \u2018j\u2019, labour productivity (LP) is obtained directly by taking the ratio of real GVA (Vj) to employment (Lj), while for the broad sectors it may be obtained as the sum of real GVA divided by the sum of employment for all the industries in the broad sector. Thus, LPj= Vj/Lj, and LPs= \u2211 \ud835\udc49\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc60\nj=1  /\u2211 \ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc60\nj=1, where LPj and LPs are labour productivity in the j th industry and the sth broad sector; Vj and Lj are the real gross value added and employment for the j th industry and s is the number of industries in a broad sector. However, labour productivity growth is computed simply by the difference of growth rate of value added and growth rate of persons employed  by UPSS.  Although labour productivity is a partial productivity measure, it is closely related to wages and, hence, to living standards.\n\nIn a gross output framework, labour productivity for jth industry is defined as gross output per person employed,  lpj=Yj/Lj and let \ud835\udc58j = Kj/\ud835\udc3fj be capital intensity or capital input per person. The growth rate of industrial labour productivity can be decomposed. Subtracting growth rate of employment (L) from both sides, TFPG ( \u2206ln AJ/Y) can be computed as the difference between labour productivity ( lpj) growth, contribution from capital deepening (kj ), contribution of labour composition (LCj) and of intermediate inputs (IIj). Then, \u2206lnlpj =  vK,j/Y  \u2206ln kj +  vL,J/Y \u0394lnLCj + v\u0305I,j/Y \u0394lnIIj + \u2206ln AJ/Y. The sources of labour productivity growth are therefore change in capital intensity, change in labour composition, change in intermediate inputs and TFP growth. However, in a gross value -added framework, which is used in the current chapter, the only contributors to labour productivity growth are three; namely - changes in labour composition, contribution of capital service per person employed or capital intensity, and TFP growth, and the growth accounting equation then is: \u2206lnlpj = vK,j/V  \u2206ln kj +  vL,J/V \u0394lnLCj + \u2206ln AJ/V."

    "input": "Question: What are the limitations in measuring output and inputs like capital and labor when assessing labor productivity, and how does this affect the measurement of Total Factor Productivity (TFP)?",
    "output": "Dieppe, et.al. (2020, p17, Box 1) points out that Capital services is a measure of the total physical capital available for production without necessarily considering how much of the existing capital is used actively in the production process ( capital utilisation). Similarly, labour input, even if it is finely measured as total working hours, does not account for variable labour effort. This may lead to an overly cyclical measure of productivity. In such a situation, TFP, which is a measure of residual does not only estimate technological change but also any error in the measurement of capital and labour.  The neglect to measure and include \u2018natural capital\u2019 as an input is also likely to over -estimate the TFP growth effect. According to Dieppe, et.al. ( 2020, p18), the measurement of new IT products and changes in the quality of ICT has not been accurately done in many national accounts. However, based on many studies on the impact of mismeasurement on the slowdown in productivity after the GFC, the author concludes (p.19) that \u201cdespite some evidence for mismeasurement it is unlikely that a significant part of the broad -based slowdown in productivity growth since the global financial crisis can be explained by it alone (Cerra and Saxena 2017; Syverson 2016).\u201d"

The first term in equation 6.6 is the within industry effect, or the effect of productivity change within each industry, denoting for each industry, the sum of change in productivity levels weighted by its respective employment share in the previous period. The second term is between industry effect\u2014a measure of worker reallocation across industries \u2014and is calculated by a change in employment weighted by levels of productivity in the previous period. If it is positive, it suggests that workers move to sectors with above -average productivity levels, and this term is often considered as a static reallocation (or between) effect  and is also described as the structural change term measuring the movement of workers from low -productivity to high -productivity industries. The last term in the equation is an interaction of change in employment share and change in productivity, and thus  it measures the combined effect of changes in employment shares and sectoral productivity in a given period \u2013 a co-variance or dynamic reallocation term (Ghani, 2013; Erumban, et.al., 2015). A positive dynamic reallocation term would suggest that the fact or input is moving to sectors that see positive productivity growth. The decomposition of labor productivity growth rates is obtained by dividing both sides of equation 6.6 by aggregate labor productivity in the previous period."

    "input": "Question: What are the trends in labor productivity for agriculture and construction sectors in India, and what factors contribute to these trends?",
    "output": "From 2008-17, labor moved out from agriculture to other labor-intensive industries with similar skill requirements, mainly construction, which experienced an acceleration of 5 percent in its growth in employment during the same period. Both agriculture and construction not only had and still have similar skill composition, with 65-68 per cent of unskilled labour and only 2.6-3.4 per cent of high-skill labour respectively, but both also employ a large proportion of the total employed persons in the economy- 49 and 11 per cent respectively. The other labor-intensive industries are all relatively small in terms of level of employment and do not have much labor absorption capacity. The only other labor-intensive industry with a sizable share in total employment in 2011-12, around 10 per cent, is trade but in 2011, it had only one -third of its employees with low skill and 15 per cent with high skill. Hence, the skill composition and requirement of this industry was different from what was available from the displacement of labor from agriculture. Thus, the trade industry had very limited capacity to absorb the labor that moved out of agriculture and employment in the industry only accelerated at an average annual growth rate of 1.2 per cent during 2008 -17. So, while the decline in employment in agriculture boosted its labor productivity, this also led to a decline in the growth in labor productivity of its labor -absorbing industry, namely construction. However, for the overall period of 1981-2017, labor productivity growth in the agriculture sector, although is lower than for the total economy, is still reasonable at 3 per cent per annum.\nWithin the manufacturing sector traditional industries such as machinery, nec.; wood and products of wood; pulp & paper; and basic metals and fabricated metal products have low labor productivity. While wood industry is labor intensive, the other industries also employ substantial labor relative to capital and are thus expected to be low in labor productivity. Further, those manufacturing industries, which lately (2008 -17) experienced a surge in the growth in labor productivity are textiles, textile products, leather and footwear, wood and products of wood; rubber and plastic products; other non -metallic mineral products; transport equipment; and manufacturing, n.e.c; recycling.\nThree industries, that are also often clubbed for analysis with the \u2018non -manufacturing\u2019 broad sector, are mining and quarrying; electricity, gas and water supply; and construction. Construction not only has the lowest labor productivity among the three, but also experienced a small negative average growth in labor productivity during 1981-2017. However, the negative growth is restricted only to the first sub -period of 198 1-93. Despite remaining a low -productivity sector, the construction sector has boomed in the post-reforms period\u2014with employment growing rapidly. The reasons for low productivity could be the massive deployment of labor in the sector especially after 2004 -05 when it absorbed most of the labor displaced from agriculture without any significant improvement in technology. So, growth in the sector\u2019s output could not keep pace with growth in employment. On the other hand, the growth in labor productivity in the electricity industry was quite high at 5.5 per cent during 198 1-93 but it subsequently became stagnant and later declined after the 2008 GFC. The mining industry however, consistently experienced an increasing rate of growth in labor productivity in all the sub-periods. One of the main reasons for its relative success is the increase in capital intensity of the industry."

The six industries from number 18 to 23 that are defined as market-services, show much variation among them (Table 6.1). While trade, and post and telecommunication record high growth in labour productivity, the other four industries \u2014hotel, transport, financial services, and business services\u2014display a relatively low growth. The trend in growth in labour productivity in these six industries is also not uniform. While \u2018Hotels and Restaurants\u2019, \u2018 Financial Services\u2019, and \u2018Business Services\u2019 show a slower growth after 2002;  the other three industries have shown a tendency of faster growth after 2002. In the non-market service sector consisting of four industries (number 24 to 27), variation in labour productivity is not substantive. These industries, except health have grown faster during 2008-17 as a result of gradual reforms in the sector and a fast pace of overall economic growth.  Figure 6.1 showing growth in labour productivity over the entire period of 1981-2017 reveals that the top five industries in terms of growth in  labour productivity are chemicals, other non -metallic mineral products, public administration, post and telecommunication, and textiles. The five industries that experienced the slowest growth are construction, wood and products of wood, machinery, n.e.c., other services, and transport & storage. Therefore, large differences in levels and growth of labour productivity across the 27 industries are observed.  These results are supported by two earlier studies \u2014by Aggarwal (2018) for 27 KLEMS industries and Goldar and Sengupta (2016) for 2-digit organised and unorganised manufacturing industries. Both these studies also find different growth rates of labour productivity in different industries within the same period and across different sub-periods."

A further investigation of the underlying factors which could explain the differences in the growth of labour productivity is attempted separately for manufacturing industries (Figure 6.2) and the services industries (Figure 6.3). The analysis shows (Figure 6.2) that generally, as expected, the average labour productivity during 1981-2017 in the 13 manufacturing industries has accelerated the fastest in the capital-intensive industries followed by labour-intensive industries and less capital-intensive industries. The same trend is also discernible in the growth in GVA as well as in employment. It indicates that high capital-intensive industries generally observe a fast growth in both GVA and employment as compared with other manufacturing industries. It is, however, observed that growth in labour productivity in the labour-intensive manufacturing industries has not followed a constant trend as it varies between different sub-periods\u2014and it was quite high during the period 2008-17 due to a deceleration of 1.8 per cent per annum in the employment growth during that period."

The same is true about the growth in GVA and employment, where we observe that the high capital-intensive service industries show higher growth in both GVA and employment, but the growth in labour productivity is almost the same because of the uniform difference in the two growth rates. Inter-temporarily, we do not find a clear trend in the labour productivity growth across service industries with varying capital intensity. The labour-intensive service industries show an impressive acceleration in labour productivity growth during all the sub-periods due to a very high growth in capital intensity in the economy at 6.9 per cent per annum during 2008-17 compared with just 2.5 per cent during 1981-93."

    "output": "Based on the analysis of the growth of labour productivity in manufacturing and service industries based on ICT: (i) during 1981-2017, within the manufacturing industries the non -ICT industries have experienced the highest labour productivity growth due to a low growth in employment, just 2 per cent per annum as compared with 5.2 for ICT-producing and 3.2 per cent for ICT-using manufacturing industries with a quite similar growth in GVA; (ii) in the service industries it is the ICT -producing industries, which show the highest growth in labour productivity due to high growth in both employment and GVA; (iii) the growth in labour productivity in the ICT -using industries has been in between the ICT -producing and non -ICT industries both in manufacturing and service industries; (iv) inter -temporarily there is no clear trend in growth of labour productivity, thus clearly reflecting the uniqueness of each of the manufacturing and the service industries. Prior to this, the capital-intensive service industries experienced a marginal slowdown in labour productivity during 2003-07 due to slowing growth in employment from 5.1 per cent during 1994-2002 to 3.4 per cent during 2003-07 and in growth in GVA from 10.6 per cent to 8.2 per cent."

    "output": "Figure 6.6 captures the contribution of the three sources of growth in labour productivity 98\u2014growth in labour quality, capital intensity (capital deepening) and TFP growth for the 27 industries\u2014for the period 1981 to 2017. The figure shows that across the 27 industries, the mean contribution of growth in capital deepening is 3 percentage points out of the mean aggregate labour productivity of 3.98 percentage points; and is followed by just 0.65 percentage points by TFP growth; and only by 0.27 percentage points by growth in labour composition index (or labour quality index). In most of the industries, the contribution of labour composition growth has been quite marginal \u2014 less than 10 per cent of its aggregate labour productivity growth (mean being only 7 per cent). It contributes more than 10 per cent to the aggregate labour productivity growth only in the three industries of transport & storage; other services; and health & social work. In 23 out of 27 industries, capital deepening growth contributed the maximum to labour productivity growth, and in the remaining four industries, it is growth in TFP that contributed the maximum to labour productivity growth. These four industries with substantial contribution by TFP growth are manufacturing, n.e.c.; transport & storage; financial services; and public administration. The contribution by TFP growth is negative in eight industries, which does not auger well for the growth of these industries or for the economy.\nFigure 6.7 reflects the findings of an investigation of the drivers of growth based on ICT use. It reveals that during 1981-2017, the average labour productivity growth rate is the highest in the ICT-producing industries and is the lowest among the non -ICT industries. It also shows that the average contribution of capital deepening is higher than TFP growth and labour quality composition in all the three types of industries\u2014ICT-producing, ICT-using and non-ICT industries. However, while the ICT -producing industries have the highest contribution from TFP growth, capital deepening has the highest contribution in the average growth of labour productivity of the non-ICT industries. Evidently, ICT plays an important role in accelerating the growth of labour productivity and positively impacts TFP growth.\nSectorally, capital -deepening growth has contributed substantially to labour productivity growth in all manufacturing industries except manufacturing, n.e.c. In the services sector, it is TFP growth that has done this (with 30 per cent or more contribution) except in trade and business services, where capital deepening has contributed more than 85 per cent of the total growth in labour productivity. In fact, capital deepening has been the primary driver in 23 of the 27 industries.\nSome reasons for capital deepening in Indian industry99 over the period are (i) reduced cost of capital (Unni, 2015), (ii) relatively low price of capital due to interest subsidies and cheap electricity (Chandrasekhar, 2008), (iii) use of new imported capital intensive technology (Felipe & Hasan, 2006), (iv) market distortions in the form of subsidies to capital and high wages in modern industries (Felipe, 2010), and (v) the emergence and growth of the \u2018new service economy\u2019 which is more capital intensive. The adoption of new technology leading to automation and increase in capital intensity of firms and industries, especially in the organised sector in India, is also confirmed by Kapoor (2016), Das et al. (2015) and Goldar (2000). But from a long-term growth prospect, it is necessary that growth in labour productivity is driven more by TFP growth rather than by factor inputs."

    "output": "As the level of labour productivity plays a crucial role in determining the level of earnings and hence the living standard of people, its growth helps in the growth of GDP of an economy. We, therefore, briefly discuss trends in the level of labour productivity in the broad sectors of the economy to understand the changes that have taken place in the structure of the Indian economy. As indicated by standard economic theory and proven by the economic history of several countries, labour would always have the incentive and the tendency to move from less -productive sectors to more -productive sectors to improve its income level. It is, therefore, expected that with economic growth, labour shifts from agriculture, which typically has the lowest relative labour productivity, to manufacturing and then to services. However, this has not happened in India, where manufacturing has been bypassed. It is, therefore, interesting to analyse the behaviour of labour productivity in India\u2019s broad sectors. Table 6.2 reflects s the average labour productivity for the broad sectors over the period 1980 to 2017 and its four sub-periods. It reveals that (i) the level of labour productivity has increased for all the broad sectors over all the sub-periods, and for the entire period, (ii) labour productivity varies across sectors, with agriculture recording the lowest level of average labour productivity, at just Rs.48,000 during 1980 -2017, as compared with Rs.165,000 in manufacturing, Rs176,000 in the market services, and Rs.240,000 in non-market services sector for the same period; (iii) while the index of labour productivity increased between 1980 and 2017 from 100 to more than"

    "output": "Between 1980 and 2017, the level of labor productivity increased across all broad sectors, but agriculture recorded the lowest average labor productivity at Rs. 48,000. In contrast, mining and quarrying, and electricity, gas, and water supply recorded very high levels of average labor productivity (Rs 795,000 and Rs 760,000 respectively) during the same period. The construction sector suffers from a low level of labor productivity (an average of Rs. 150,000 during 1980-2017), and both the level and index have declined during the recent period.\n\nIn high capital-intensity industries like coke, chemicals, and transport equipment, labor productivity has grown faster than in other manufacturing industries, mainly due to capital deepening. Similarly, in capital-intensive service industries such as post & telecommunication, business services, public administration, and other services, capital deepening has been the primary driver of labor productivity growth, with public administration also showing a significant contribution from TFP growth. This indicates that in India's labor-surplus economy, capital-intensity, rather than labor, has accelerated the growth in labor productivity."

    "output": "The trends in the growth of labor productivity at broad sector level for the period 1981 to 2017 are summarized in Table 6.3, which shows that the average growth rate of labor productivity for the total economy has an upward trend during the four sub-periods. While the growth was less than 4 per cent before 2002, it was more than 6 per cent during the subsequent period of 2003-17. It is also seen from table that labor productivity in the four broad sectors \u2014 agriculture, mining, manufacturing and services (market and non-market) accelerating during the period 2003-17 in comparison with the period 1981-2002. The electricity sector also recorded a high rate of growth in labor productivity at more than 4 per cent, although the rate slowed in the later sub-periods. The construction sector, on the other hand, experienced much volatility and an overall negative growth in labor productivity. Two recent studies also observed acceleration in growth in labor productivity for the economy and for the manufacturing sector in the post -2000 period. Aggarwal (2018) finds that for the 27 India KLEMS industries, the median growth of labor productivity is 6.7 per cent per annum during 2003 -11 as compared with 5 per cent per annum during 1994 -2002. Goldar and Sengupta (2016) noted that labor productivity growth for total Indian manufacturing during 1999-2010 was 5.4 per cent per annum as compared with 3.8 per cent per annum during 1990-99. Analysing labor productivity in India, Dieppe (ed. 2020) has pointed out that labor productivity in India remained low during 1980s due to India\u2019s controlled economy with heavy regulation (the \u201clicense raj\u201d) and widespread corruption that stifled manufacturing, investment, and technology adoption. But, after the reforms of 1991, many restrictions on product and factor markets were reduced and trade was made freer with reduced restrictions, spurring a surge in productivity growth (Rodrik and Subramanian 2005; Virmani and Hashim 2011). However, the level of labor productivity in India remains very low, despite some recent convergence, as compared with advanced countries and many EMDEs."

For Market Services the growth rates were 2.28, 4.99, 6.35, 5.63 and 4.39 respectively. For Non-Market Services the growth rates were 3.77, 2.28, 2.35, 5.10 and 3.58 respectively. For the Total economy the growth rates were 3.03, 3.66, 6.08, 6.26 and 4.47 respectively. While Table 6.3 may give the impression that the manufacturing and mining sectors were very strong contributors towards the overall growth in labour productivity for the economy during 1981-2017, it is noteworthy that both these sectors have a relatively low share in both employment and value added. It would be interesting to understand the dynamics of productivity change across industries and sectors and the contribution of broad sectors to aggregate labour productivity growth. Aggregate labour productivity growth has increased from 3 per cent during 1981-93 to 3.74 per cent during 1994-2002, 6.29 per cent during 2003-07 and to 6.47 per cent during 2008-17. The within industry productivity growth contributed 75 per cent of the aggregate labour productivity growth during 1981-2017 (3.44 percentage points of the 4.60 percentage points), and the remaining part 25 per cent (1.16 percentage points) can be attributed mainly to between industry effect, indicating that the Indian economy has experienced a structural change. The dynamic reallocation effect has been negligible in the economy. The impact of overall reallocation has been positive throughout. The structural change (static reallocation effect) has been quite limited \u2014only 32 per cent during 1981-93 and around 25 per cent since 2003."

On considering static and dynamic effect separately, we observe that on an average, there has been almost no dynamic reallocation effect throughout the period and the index remains stagnant around the base value of 100. The dynamic effect has been contributing less, suggesting that employment has hardly been generated in sectors, which have witnessed faster labour productivity growth. The static reallocation effect, however, has been positive throughout the period, with steep rise since 2003 -04, suggesting a positive structural change effect. In general, the effect of structural change \u2014 in terms of workers moving to sectors with high productivity level \u2014 on labour productivity growth has been positive, though the magnitude of the effect varies substantially over the years."

    "output": "In this section, the contribution of different sectors to aggregate labor productivity growth is investigated. While equation 6.5 gives aggregate labour productivity directly at the level of the aggregate economy, the second method to find the aggregate labour productivity growth is as the weighted sum of the 27 individual lpjt, with weights being the employment share of each industry \u2018j\u2019 (sjt) in total employment at time t. Hence, we may write  \\( L{P_t} = \\frac{{V{A_t}}}{{{L_t}}} = \\mathop \\sum \\limits_{j = 1}^{27} l{p_{j,t}}{s_{j,t}} \\) (6.7). While equation 6.5 gives the aggregate labour productivity, equation 6. 7 provides within industry labour productivity and accounts for the changing weights of each industry over the period. In Figure 6.12, the broad sectors\u2019 contribution to within industry labour productivity growth rate for the sub-periods and for the total period are summarised, and each broad sector\u2019s contribution is expressed as a proportion of the aggregate productivity growth 100. During 1981-1993, out of the within industry labour productivity growth rate of 2.11 per cent, it is the services sector that has dominated \u2014contributing almost 46 per cent to productivity growth. While agriculture contributed 31 per cent, the manufacturing sector contributed 22 per cent, mining and electricity around 5 -6 per cent each, but the construction sector experienced a decline in labour productivity. The picture has changed during the subsequent sub periods and in 2008-17 when within industry labour productivity growth has accelerated to 4.8 per cent, the contribution of services has also experienced a jump from 46 per cent to 54 per cent. The acceleration in labour productivity growth of the service sector might have induced some labour to shift from less-productive agriculture to services. Because of slow growth in labour productivity for both agriculture and manufacturing, their relative contribution has reduced between 1981-93 and 2008-17, from 31 per cent to 20 per cent for agriculture and from 22 per cent to 20 per cent for manufacturing. However, the contribution by the non -manufacturing industries (mining, electricity and construction) to labour productivity growth, which was almost negligible at 1 per cent during 1981-93, has gone up to 5.8 per cent in 2008-17. This has happened despite a massive shift of labour to the non-manufacturing sector whereby its employment share increased almost five-fold from a low of 2.8 per cent to 12.4 per cent from 1980 to 2017."

    "output": "Figure 6.13 shows the labour productivity of selected countries in comparison with China. OECD (2016) analyzed the paradox of falling growth in labour productivity despite substantive technological progress in many developed countries since mid-1990s, plausibly explaining it by the structural change in the economies in terms of a shift from the more-productive manufacturing towards growth of less-productive personal services ( ibid, p.18). Based on an analysis of labour productivity across the globe, Dieppe (ed. 2020) concluded that while labour productivity growth halved between 1980 and the beginning of the GFC, i.e., 2008 in the advanced countries, in the EMDEs it accelerated after the slowdown of the 1980s. However, after the 2008 GFC, the slowdown in productivity affected 70 per cent of all the economies, both advanced and EMDEs. The report (Dana, et.al., pp. 265) however, mentions that out of the six regions in EMDE, South Asia where India is the dominant economy, slowed only mildly after the GFC and its productivity growth was second fastest among these six regions at 5.3 per cent a year during 2013 -18. India, however, seems to have buckled this trend with an acceleration in its labour productivity growth due to adoption of ICT by its dominant services sector. He finds that while slowdown of investment is the main reason for slowdown in productivity in advance economies during the last decade, the reason in the EMDEs is equal slowdown in both investment and TFP growth. The report (Dieppe, 2020, p. i17) finds that many different factors have affected long-term growth in labour productivity, but it mainly depends on \u2018innovation, physical capital investment, and investment in human capital\u2019."

    "input": "Question: What factors influence labor productivity growth in Indian industries, and how does India's labor productivity compare to other countries like China?",
    "output": "Living conditions of workers generally depend on their labour productivity. The change in labour productivity between the two periods of 1994 to 2007 and 2008 to 2017 has also varied considerably  \u2014 ranging from more-than 14 per cent to negative nine per cent. The analysis also reveals that labour productivity growth has been faster in industries that are more capital -intensive and the growth is also faster in ICT -producing and ICT-using industries than non-ICT industries. The drivers of labour productivity growth  \u2014 capital deepening, labour quality or labour compositional changes, and TFP growth have also been estimated. In most (23 industries out of 27) industries, growth in capital intensity is the key driver, and TFP growth contributed significantly only to four industries. Evidently, it is factor accumulation that is leading to growth in labour productivity and the contributions of growth in labour composition and TFP growth are marginal\u2014so more than the quality of factors, it is the quantity which is the main source of labour productivity growth. On the other hand, we find that TFP growth contributed a substantive 40 per cent to the aggregate labour productivity growth in the ICT-producing industries (three), 28 per cent in ICT-using industries (nine) even as it contributed a mere 4 per cent in the non-ICT industries (15). From a long-term perspective of growth of the economy, it is growth in TFP and growth in labour composition which are desirable and sustainable and not growth in capital deepening. Since out of total 27 industries, only 12 industries are either ICT -producing or ICT-using where TFP growth contribution is significant, the focus therefore must be on inc entivising industries to either produce more or use more of ICT, in which India fortunately has a comparative advantage. It has also been found that a few industries in the Indian economy have followed the virtuous path of high growth in employment as well  as high growth in labour productivity. These industries along with others with similar potential could be harnessed in the future through proper policy incentives to foster growth in employment and productivity. Industry decomposition of labour productivity growth shows that aggregate productivity growth is explained majorly by within industry productivity growth, and between industry or structural change explains only a marginal share. The static reallocation effect (within effect plus between effect) has been positive and is 25 percent of the aggregate productivity growth  in the entire period 1980-2017, suggesting a positive structural change effect. The dynamic effect has been mostly negligible in most of the years, suggesting that employment has hardly been generated in sectors which were witnessing faster productivity growth. The analysis also makes it very clear that the major contribution to the aggregate productivity growth has come from the service sector in all the sub-periods, especially immediately after the reform process had begun in India in 1990s, and in 2008-17. A cross-country comparison, however, reveals that despite achieving one of the highest growths in labour productivity at an average of 5 per cent per annum during 198 1-2017, the level of labour productivity in India is still very low in comparison with several other countries. With China as the benchmark, it is observed that while India and China had almost the same level of labour productivity in 1980, by 2018 the leve l in India had become just three -fourth of that in China. There is need for further investigation into the reasons for the low level of labour productivity in India. Some of the plausible reasons could be the increasing capital deepening where industry is substituting labour with capital because of the low cost of capital, mismatch of labour skills, rigid labour laws, obsolescence of technology in major sectors of agriculture and manufacturing, and emergence of the \u2018new economy\u2019 that is services -centred and require less, albeit skilled labour."

Research based on the India KLEMS Database has provided a major turnaround in growth and productivity analysis. Moving beyond aggregate and sectoral perspectives it has focused on a disaggregated industry-level approach\u2014allowing researchers to analyse the considerable heterogeneity in the performance parameters of the 27 India KLEMS industries. This type of disaggregated analysis has been followed by several studies (Das et al., 2016, Goldar et al., 2017 and Erumban et al., 2019)."

    "output": "This chapter carries forward such analysis by addressing the sources of India\u2019s growth and productivity, using the approach outlined in Jorgenson et al. (2005). The major attribute of this chapter is its use of the Production Possibility Frontier (PPF) approach, which is methodologically superior over the more traditional method of using an Aggregate Production Function (APF). Our use of the Production Possibility Frontier approach enables quantification of the sources of growth at the industry-level in order to understand how changes in technology, production processes and input decisions across industries can contribute to aggregate economic growth . In addition,  comparing the contributions of inputs \u2014primary and intermediate\u2014with the role of productivity improvement helps identify whether it is input accumulation or TFP growth  that led to higher growth . The analysis also helps understand that if indeed there is an improvement in aggregate output and productivity growth, which industries are driving the origins of the observed growth patterns ."

    "output": "The literature suggests that the agricultural productivity attained during the 1980s was not sustained in the 1990s (Kumar and Mittal, 2006). Studies based on the India-KLEMS dataset have been able to push the growth and productivity literature beyond the sectoral and aggregate perspective, by building industry -production accounts at the disaggregated level of 27 industries. An important recent study by Goldar et al. (2017), closely resembling the PPF methodology of this chapter, use d the India -KLEMS dataset version of 2016 to analyse growth, structural change , and productivity of the Indian economy during 1980-2014. The trend annual growth rate of aggregate value-added was found to have progressed from 5 per cent in 1980-93, to 5.8 per cent in 1994-02 and 7.5 per cent during 2003 -14. Notably, the study showed that the real value -added share of the manufacturing sector does not stagnate when a double deflation approach is applied, in contrast to the stagnant manufacturing share observed when using a single deflated value -added series. In terms of aggregate TFP gr owth, the study carrie d out a Domar aggregation exercise which revealed that manufacturing, non-market services and market services were the largest contribut ors to the aggregate TFP growth for 1980 -14. The dynamics of structural changes were analysed by decomposing labour and capital productivity with the assumption of an Aggregate Production Function (APF). For both labour and capital productivity during 1980-14, the study found that although within-industry productivity growth accounted for most of the labour and capital productivity growth, positive static reallocation effects were present and were relatively substantial compared with dynamic reallocation effects. Das et al. (2016) is a major attempt to highlight India\u2019s productivity performance under different policy regimes. The study identifies that liberal market reforms in the 1990s seem to have benefitted market services in expanding investment, productivity, and growth in the post reform period, while helping manufacturing productivity through a long period of intensive capital accumulation. Erumban et al. (2019) followed the Goldar et al. study by utilising the assumption of an APF to decompose labour productivity growth and found results similar to the latter study. Additionally, using the Direct Aggregation across Industries (DAI) extension of the PPF approach, the study found that labour and capital reallocation effects (in accounting for aggregate TFP growth) were a round 17 per cent per annum and 10 per cent per annum, respectively, for 1981-2011. Notably, the capital reallocation effect was negative for 1981-92, indicating that investment was flowing to industries with lower returns to capital during this period. Ho wever, the capital reallocation effect was positive and substantially higher than the labour reallocation effect since the mid -1990s till 2011\u2014indicating that during this period, investment expanded in industries where capital was more productive. Das and Nath (2017) highlight \u201ccapital misallocation and its implications for India\u2019s potential output\u201d. They show that several sub-sectors in the services sector appear to be \u2018over-capitalised\u2019. On the other hand, several manufacturing subsectors are \u2018under-capitalised\u2019. Their results imply that aggregate output would have been higher by 20-30 per cent between 1990 and 2004 and 40 per cent between 2005 and 2012"

    "output": "Aggarwal and Goldar (2019) investigated the structure and trends of employment growth in the Indian economy from 1980-81 to 2015-16 using the India KLEMS dataset. They found that GDP growth after 1991 did not result in a commensurate increase in employment, particularly during 2003-15, when employment elasticity was 0.1. Krishna et al. (2020) used an econometric approach to analyze the impact of participation in Global Value Chains (GVCs) on the TFP index of 12 India KLEMS manufacturing industries from 1993-2015. They found that foreign value added (FVA) content in production had a significant positive coefficient, indicating that GVC participation helped the Indian manufacturing sector achieve higher productivity. They also found that a higher equipment share in total capital stocks was productivity-enhancing. Furthermore, Krishna et al. (2018) explored productivity trends in the manufacturing sector, focusing on formal and informal segments from 1980-81 to 2011-12, revealing that informal segments were less efficient, suggesting a need to raise output and employment of the formal segment. Das and Nath (2017) also showed that several sub-sectors in the services sector appear to be \u2018over-capitalised\u2019 while several manufacturing subsectors are \u2018under-capitalised\u2019, implying that aggregate output would have been higher by 20-30 per cent between 1990 and 2004 and 40 per cent between 2005 and 2012 had the distortions in capital allocation been removed. They conclude that a policy framework enabling ease of capital movement across sectors may be adopted for achieving higher growth."

    "output": "The assumptions underlying the existence of an aggregate production function are:\n\n1.  Each industry must have a gross output production function that is separable in value-added, where value-added is a function of industry capital, labor, and technology.\n2.  The value-added function is the same or identical across all industries (identical output prices across industries).\n3.  The functions that aggregate heterogeneous types of capital and labor must be identical in all industries.\n4.  Each specific type of capital and labor must receive the same price in all industries.\n\nGiven the literature on resources misallocation in India and the widely recognized existing institutional deficiencies, the assumptions of the APF approach are difficult to back. However, the Production Possibility Frontier (PPF) approach as outlined in Jorgenson et al. (2005) does not require the assumption of the existence of identical industry value-added functions and allows the extension to the least restrictive \u201cDirect Aggregation across Industries\u201d approach (discussed later in this chapter). Thus, the PPF approach provides a much more theoretically sound framework to analyze the industry origins of growth and productivity of the Indian economy and is the preferred beginning point for the purpose of aggregation."

    "output": "The gross output of an industry is defined as the value of production created using primary factors such as labor and capital, and intermediate inputs purchased from other industries. As per the growth accounting methodology outlined in Jorgenson et al. (2005) and discussed in Chapter 2, the gross output of each industry is defined as a function of capital, labor, intermediate inputs, and technology. An important advantage of using the gross output framework is that it provides a complete measure of production and treats all inputs\u2014labor, capital, and intermediate inputs\u2014symmetrically. In contrast, the value-added measure of output does not explicitly account for the flow of intermediate inputs that may be the primary component of an industry\u2019s output. By utilizing industry-level gross output growth decomposition as shown previously in equation (7.1), industry-level estimates are summarized in Table 7.1, showing that the 27 industries saw an average annual output growth rate of around 7.39 per cent, while the industry median was slightly lower at 7.33 per cent for the overall period of 1980-2017. Capital input contribution emerges as the second most important source of output growth after intermediate inputs."

The average contribution of Material input across the 27 industries is around 2.63 per cent, which is substantially higher than the corresponding average figure for Energy (0.35 per cent) and Services input contribution (1.18 per cent). However, the contribution of the Services input is the dominant source of intermediate input contribution for nine industries, namely \u2014Agriculture & allied, Utilities, Trade, Transport & storage, Financial services, Business services, Public administration, Education, and Other Services.

Although these five industries account for more than half of the aggregate value-added for the period considered, the Agriculture & allied industry itself accounts for a quarter of the aggregate value added.  The value-added growth of the Agriculture & allied industry was only 3.11 per cent, the second lowest among the 27 industries, indicating that this industry's large contribution was emanated from its large size in the economy rather than high growth. In contrast, the contributions of the other four industries, all four from the service sector, are driven by relatively strong value-added growth rates and value-added shares.  Even when considering the top 10 contributors, they are predominantly service sector industries, except Construction and Utilities.  The relatively smaller contributions from the Manufacturing industries result from their minor share in aggregate value-added rather than slow value-added growth. Several Manufacturing industries experienced high rates of value-added growth rates, including Electrical & optical eqpt., Rubber & plastic products, Other manufacturing, and Transport equipment."

    "output": "Before discussing the industry-level contributions to aggregate TFP growth, it is important to note that according to theory, the Domar weights typically add up to more than one (they add up to exactly two in our case, as shown in the last row of Table 7.3 ). This usually implies that in the presence of intermediate transactions between the industries (or the use of intermediate inputs), aggregate productivity growth will be greater than the weighted average growth rates of the industries. This means, productivity gains from the production of intermediate inputs have an additional effect of reducing input prices in downstream industries. Figure 7.3 provides the ranking of industries in terms of their (Domar-weighted) contributions to aggregate TFP growth (\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc43,\ud835\udc57) for the overall period of 1981-2017. As in the case of value-added growth, Agriculture & allied industry retains its position as the largest contributor to aggregate TFP growth. The other substantial contributors include \u2013 Public administration, Other services, Transport & storage, and Utilities. Unlike the contributions to aggregate value-added growth, the industry contributions to aggregate TFP growth are negative for a small subset of industries, namely \u2014Construction, Mining & quarrying, Wood & wood products and Business services. Thus, we observe substantial heterogeneity in terms of industry contributions to aggregate TFP growth. The construction sector seems to be the largest drag on aggregate TFP growth.

Overall, contributions from Manufacturing industries were relatively lower than from Service industries. This reflects the combination of relatively slower employment growth in the manufacturing sector (1.58 per cent) compared with the service sector (3. 20 per cent), and a relatively high value-added share of the service sector (45 per cent) compared with a mere 18 per cent share of the manufacturing sector during the period under consideration."

    "output": "The 2008 Global Financial Crisis (GFC) had serious implications for the growth path of many economies. Although India\u2019s economic engagement with the world had increased since the 1990s, several factors allowed India to insulate itself from the shocks of the GFC \u2014 a well-capitalised and regulated financial sector, large stocks of foreign reserves, and a gradual pace of opening its capital account. To analyze whether India\u2019s underlying industrial anatomy underwent a change following the GFC, the post-1993 period is divided into a pre-crisis period of 1993-2007 and a post-crisis period of 2008-17. The financial year 1993-94 is taken as the starting point because the phase of full-scale industrial deregulation started from this point, lasting till 2000-01, followed by the high economic growth phase from 2002-03 to 2007-08. Thus, the pre-crisis sub-period incorporates the phase of systematic economic liberalization followed by the phase of high growth. The post-crisis sub-period of 2008-17 is also considered."

    "output": "To maintain coherency, the estimates are presented as per the sequence already followed in the chapter. Thus, the analysis starts by exploring the change in sources of output growth, followed by the change in industry contributions to aggregate growth and productivity, and the corresponding industry contributions to the growth of aggregate primary inputs. These changes are estimated by subtracting the annually averaged results for the post-crisis sub-period of 2008-17 from that of pre-crisis sub-period of 1993-07. A heterogenous picture emerges in terms of changes in output growth rates after the global financial crisis. A post-2007 acceleration in output growth was observed for 13 out of the 27 industries, with the relatively higher increases in output growth seen in Wood & wood products, Rubber & plastic products, Education, and Transport equipment. There was a notable decline in the performance of some Service industries, particularly Hotels & restaurants and Post & telecom industries. Several Manufacturing industries also saw a decline in output growth rate, with notable declines in Food products, beverages & tobacco at -3.72 percentage points (ppts), Coke & petroleum products (-2.72 ppts.) and Chemical & chemical products (-2.69 ppts.). Capital input increased in importance as a source of output growth for 11 out of the 27 industries. Of these, the largest post-2007 increase in capital contribution was seen in Trade at 3.86 ppts., while the corresponding increase in contribution for the rest of the 10 industries ranged from 0.12 to 1.25 ppts. The Agriculture & allied, Mining & quarrying and Utilities industries also experienced an increase in contribution from capital input. The largest deceleration in capital input contribution was experienced by two Services industries, namely \u2014 Financial services and Business services.

    "output": "Most of the post-2007 changes in capital input contribution were due to changes in capital stock contribution, rather than capital quality since the former were higher than the latter. Although, an important observation emerges for several industries that saw a post-2007 deceleration in overall capital input contribution \u2014out of 16 such industries, 12 saw a (minor) increase in contribution from capital quality growth. However, the decline in capital stock contribution was overwhelming enough in all these cases, thus decreasing the overall capital input contribution. Looking at the changes in contribution from the second primary input i.e., labour, we observe a rather stark picture (Figure 7.8). The post-2007 changes in contributions from labour input are much less in absolute magnitude compared with the spread in the changes of capital input contributions. Thus, the changes in the former were less volatile for the second sub -period of 2008-17. Except for only four industries \u2014Utilities, Electrical & optical equipment (both registered an increase) , Machinery, n .e.c., and Coke & petroleum products (both remained somewhat unchanged), the rest of the 23 industries saw a decline in contribution from labour input for their respective output growth rates."

As seen i n Table 7A.5 of the Annexure, similar to the case of capital input, the associated post-2007 changes in weights for labour input were minor. Thus, the post-2007 changes in labour input growth drove the changes in industry contributions to aggregate labour input growth over the two sub -periods. It is observed that most of the industries (19 out of 27), saw a decline in their post -2007 contributions, with the largest declines observed for the Agriculture & allied (-0.27 ppts.), Trade (0.09 ppts.) and Other services (-0.07 ppts.) industries. On the other hand, the Business services industry (which is mostly skill-intensive in nature) saw the largest increase in contribution of 0.09 ppts. Although the Agriculture & allied industry saw the largest decline in contribution, the largest post-2007 fall in employment growth was observed for the Post & telecom industry at -7.40 ppts (refer to Table 7A.6). Further, the relatively large fall in contribution from the Agriculture & allied industry was a combination of a post-2007 decrease in employment of -2.40 ppts. and the largest fall in weights among the 27 industries at -0.03 ppts. We also find that the relatively largest fall in associated weight for the Agriculture & allied industry was primarily an outcome of its relatively largest post -2007 decline in value -added share in aggregate value -added (as shown by the changes in VA shares in Table 7A.4 of Annexure 7A)."

All three sub-sectors of Manufacturing grew above the economy average, with growth in Manufacturing of Investment goods the highest at around 11 percent per annum. Accounting for the observed value-added growth, TFP continues to be a small contributor while capital stock drives much of it. Comparing the Manufacturing sector with Services, capital input and TFP remain the two main contributors to observed growth with a larger absolute contribution by capital stock for the Manufacturing sector relative to Services.\n\nFor the period 1980-2017, the Services sector was the leading contributor (3.20 ppts.) to aggregate value-added growth, followed by the Manufacturing sector (1.51 ppts.). Amongst the Manufacturing sub-groups, the largest contribution came from the Manufacturing of Intermediate Goods at 0.67 ppts. This sector grew substantially at an average of 8.40 percent per annum, despite its small share in aggregate value-added at 8 percent.\n\nThe Investment Manufacturing sub-sector showed the fastest value-added growth of 11.14 percent per annum although its share in aggregate value-added was the smallest at 4 percent, for the overall period. Within the Services sector, the Market services sub-sector showed an almost 2 ppts. higher value-added growth than the Non-Market services sub-sector, even though both had a similar share in aggregate value-added in the range of 20-25 percent."

Aggregate TFP Growth was 2.09. The bottom panel of Table 7.6 provides the estimates of the considerable reallocation effects of labour and capital in accounting for aggregate TFP growth. Thus, after accounting for the industry/sectoral contributions, the total reallocation effect is a sum of 0.59 per cent contribution from reallocation of labour and 0.54 per cent contribution from reallocation of capital. As mentioned before, these reallocation effects quantify the departure from the assumption that each type of labour and capital face the same prices in all industries. Since we observe a positive reallocation effect for the overall period of 1980-2017, it can be concluded that different types of capital and labour commanded different prices in the component industries/sectors, and industries/sectors with higher corresponding prices saw higher input growth rates when compared with the economy average. If higher input prices are taken as a reflection of higher marginal productivity (as the assumption of perfectly competitive input markets would imply), it can also be concluded that on an average for 1980-2017, factors shifted to more productive industries/sectors."

    "output": "Overall, capital input increased its contribution to aggregate value-added growth in the second sub-period (2008-2017), while the contribution from labour input declined. The change in contribution from aggregate TFP growth over the two sub-periods was negligible. Value-added growth obtained from the PPF approach did not show any substantial acceleration as well. Thus, it appears that the underlying changes in contributions from capital and labour in opposite directions and in nearly equal absolute magnitude combined with negligible change in aggregate TFP growth led to the outcome of little to no acceleration in aggregate value-added growth. The sectoral contributions to aggregate value-added and TFP growth have already been addressed previously; aggregate TFP growth primarily reflects TFP growth from the component industries within the aggregated sectors, with major contributions from Services (0.61 per cent) and Manufacturing (0.31 per cent)."

    "output": "This chapter provides a comprehensive analysis of India\u2019s growth and productivity by examining the disaggregated industry-level production accounts for the 27 India KLEMS industries and six broad sectors that make up the India economy. Growth and productivity dynamics are analysed for the overall period of 1980 -2017 and for two sub -periods pertaining to post -systematic reforms/pre-GFC (1993 -07) and global productivity slowdown/post -GFC (2008 -17). The gross output framework is used to examine the industry-level sources of output growth while the methodologically superior and practically sound Production Possibility Frontier (PPF) approach is used to analyse the origins of aggregate value-added and TFP growth. The limitations of the PPF approach are also addressed by estimating the reallocation effects of labour and capital, which signify a departure from the PPF\u2019s assumption that different types of labour and capital receive the same prices in all industries. Analysis of industry -level output growth rates for 1981 -2017 reveals that the output growth rates of 27 India KLEMS industries follow a normal distribution, with the majority of the output growth rates closer to the industry mean of 7.39 per cent per annum. Among the few industries that saw output growth rates higher than the industry mean, the Business services industries saw the relatively highest growth of 12.4 per cent per annum. Decomposition of industry-level output growth for 1981 -2017 reveals that intermediate inputs were by far the largest contributors with an industry mean of 4.16 ppts. Within intermediate inputs, most of the contribution was driven by Material (M) input, especially for industries in the Manufacturing sector. Although the contribution from Services input was also substantial for industries such as Agriculture & allied, Utilities and six industries in the Servic es sector\u2014indicating the importance of intermediate transactions within this sector. Capital input was the second most important contributor, especially for Services industries such as Trade, Business services, and Financial services \u2014indicating high capital intensity in these industries. However, labour input contribution to output growth was very minor, at an industry average of less than one per cent per annum  with a few exceptions such as  Education and Business services. Given the l arge workforce in the country, this is a cause for much concern. The quality components of the primary inputs i.e., the contribution from capital and labour quality were marginal for the overall period. However, labour quality was the dominant source of labour input contribution for four industries\u2014Public administration, Wood & wood products, Mining & quarrying, and Agriculture & allied \u2014mostly due to the little to no employment growth in these industries compared with favourable labour quality growth rates, for the overall period. Finally, TFP contribution to output growth (or simply gross output based TFP growth rates) also follow s a normal distribution with most of the growth rates near the industry average of 0.47 per cent per annum. The contributions from TFP growth were negligible for most of the industries, except Public administration. However, the estimate of TFP growth in the case of Public administration needs to be interpreted with caution (for reasons given earlier). Overall, for the 1981-2017 period, we observe that input accumulation drove the output growth rates in the Indian economy rather than improvements in efficiency.  Decomposition of industry-level output growth for 1981-2017 reveals that intermediate inputs were by far the largest contributors, with material input as the key driver, followed by capital input"

    "output": "Utilising the PPF approach, the largest contributors to aggregate value-added growth for the overall period of 1981-2017 include Agriculture & allied and Services industries\u2014Trade, Other services, Business services and Financial services. While the contribution from the Agriculture & allied sector was largely due to its high share in aggregate value-added (25 per cent per annum), the contributions from the above-mentioned Services industries reflect both, their high shares in aggregate value-added and their high value-added growth. Strikingly, the industries in the Manufacturing sector performed poorly in terms of their contributions.\n\nFrom the Direct Aggregation across Industries (DAI) exercise, Agriculture & allied and Public administration industries made the largest contributions to aggregate TFP growth for the overall period. Service industries were large contributors to aggregate growth of both capital and labour input. The relatively lower contributions from Manufacturing industries towards aggregate labour input growth is a matter of concern and reflects the poor employment growth in this sector. Looking at the pre (1993-07) and post GFC (2008-17) growth and productivity dynamics, a fall in labour input contribution across the board in the post-GFC period is found. A post-2007 acceleration in contributions to aggregate value-added growth is observed for five Service sector industries. A post -2007 acceleration in contrib ution to aggregate TFP growth is noted for capital -intensive Manufacturing industries, the corresponding contribution from Market services industries saw a decline. It is found that 19 out of the 27 India KLEMS industries saw a decline in their contribution to aggregate labour input growth in the second sub-period, with the largest decline in contributions from the Agriculture & allied and Trade industries."

Over the two sub-periods (1993-07 and 2008-17), the Non-Market services sub-sector saw an increase in its contribution to aggregate TFP growth, while there was a decline in the corresponding contribution from the Market services sub-sector.

    "output": "Chapter 8 focuses on the analysis of growth in real Gross Value Added (GVA), employment, and productivity for the 27 KLEMS industries. Unlike previous chapters, it specifically examines the differences in the performances of the formal and informal segments within the manufacturing sector. The formal segment of manufacturing refers to the organised or registered manufacturing enterprises/establishments, while the informal segment refers to the unorganised or unregistered enterprises/establishments. In the National Accounts Statistics (NAS) series with 2004-05 base and its corresponding back series, a distinction is made between \u201cregistered\u201d and \u201cunregistered\u201d segments of Indian manufacturing industries. \u201cRegistered\u201d segment in NAS refers to those manufacturing establishments which are registered as \u201cFactories\u201d under the Indian Factories Act, 1948 (which applies to factories employing 10 or more workers with the use of power or 20 or more workers without the use of power) or establishments registered as such under the Bidi and Cigar workers (conditions of employment) Act, 1966 with similar requirement on employment size. For the present analysis, this segment is being treated as organised or formal manufacturing, and the rest as unorganised or informal manufacturing.

Informal work exists in all countries, irrespective of the individual country\u2019s level of socio-economic development, but it is far more prevalent in developing countries\u201d. Most people \u201cengaged in the informal economy are exposed to inadequate and unsafe working conditions, and have high illiteracy levels, low skill levels and inadequate training opportunities; have less certain, less regular and lower incomes than those in the formal economy, suffer longer working hours, an absence of collective bargaining and representation rights and, often, an ambiguous or disguised employment status; and are physically and financially more vulnerable because work in the informal economy is either excluded from, or effectively beyond, the reach of social security schemes and safety and health, maternity and other labour protection legislation\u201d (ILO, 2014, p3). Since the workers do not have social protection, they find it hard to improve their living standards and come out of poverty.

    "output": "Based on the definition of \u2018informal employment\u2019, ILO (2018b) provides estimates of informal employment, its composition and magnitude besides other characteristics. In this definition of informal employment, as well as that in ILO (2013), persons in informal employment outside the informal sector are specifically defined as (a) employees in formal enterprises not covered by social protection through their work; (b) paid domestic workers not covered by social protection through their work; and (c) contributing family workers working in formal enterprises. This attention is confined to non-agricultural activities. According to the text, Employment in the informal economy can be defined as the sum of employment in the informal sector and of informal employment found outside the informal sector (formal enterprises and households). Table 8.1 provides a summary of the extent of informality in the non-agriculture economy for select developing and BRICS countries and some developed countries. It shows that among the developing countries, the relatively richer countries, e.g., Brazil, Korea, Russia and South Africa have less than half of the persons employed in non-agriculture informal employment, but the informal employment outside the informal sector is one-third in Brazil, Russia and South Africa and one-fifth in Korea (out of total non-agriculture informal employment). On the other hand, the extent of informal employment is more than 50 per cent in the other developing countries \u2014 Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, and Vietnam with the lowest being 54 per cent in China and the highest in Bangladesh and India at 82 per cent and 78 per cent respectively. However, while Bangladesh has a very high share of informality outside the informal sector (40 per cent), the other countries in this group still have low shares of informality outside the informal sector. This indicates how these countries still depend predominantly on the non-agriculture, informal sector. Among the developed countries, as expected, the share of informal employment in total non-agriculture employment is very low at less than one-fifth (only one-tenth in France), and the maximum share of informal employment comes from the informal sector. Thus, the share of informal employment, generally, depends on the level of development of the country. Also, it seems reasonable to argue that unless the countries with high level of informal employment are able to increase their level of development and adopt suitable policies to reduce informality, it may not be possible for them to succeed in their endevour to reduce informality."

    "output": "According to the National Commission for Enterprises in the Unorganised Sector (NCEUS) proposed in 2009: \u201cThe informal sector consists of all incorporated private enterprises owned by individuals or households engaged in the sale and production of goods and services operated on a proprietary or partnership basis and with less than ten total workers.\u201d The term \u201centerprises\u201d in the above definition includes all workers in the agricultural sector except those in plantations. This is so because workers in the plantation sectors are protected under the Plantations Labour Act, 19 51 (Naik, 2009). Such enterprises generally do not fall under the purview of most legislation that governs the organised sector (e.g., for registration of enterprises, and for labour protection). The cornerstone of such legislation, such as labour laws, has been the historical concept of \u201cemployment relationship\u201d (ILO, 2003; Chen et al, 2004). The conundrum is that this \u201cemployment relationship\u201d is often not defined for the informal sector. The employment relationship may be disguised to avoid falling under the purview of laws. For instance, bidi traders in Ahmedabad claim that they sell tobacco and other related materials to bidi producers. They then buy the bidis from them, thereby avoiding any legal requirements to pay retirement benefits to the bidi producers (Chen, 2006). The definition and basic features of informal sector in India naturally raise questions regarding the linkages it has with the formal sectors of the economy. Ranis and Stewart (1999) show that informal sector produces consumer goods aimed mainly at lower-end customers\u2014goods that often compete with those from the formal sector. Another school of thought contends that the informal sector is integrated with the rest of the economy through complementary linkages (ILO, 1991). Legalists argue that stringent regulations that restrict the organised sector also perpetuate inefficiencies in the unorganised sector. However, there is some consensus that the lack of legislation that often characterises most of the informal sector also plays an important role in its perpetuation. The lack of legislation governing street vendors in Legalists argue that stringent regulations that restrict the organised sector also perpetuate inefficiencies in the unorganised sector. However, there is some consensus that the lack of legislation that often characterises the informal sector also plays an important role in its perpetuation."

    "input": "Question: How do the formal and informal segments of the manufacturing sector commonly interact?",
    "output": "One common way in which the formal and informal segments of the manufacturing sector interact is through sub-contracting. Many economic relations of production fall somewhere between the two extremes of pure organised and pure unorganised segments. Workers are known to move between points in this spectrum with varying levels of ease and speed (Chen, 2004). For instance, a big garment producing firm may try to reduce its cost of stitching by sub-contracting to small tailors in the informal sector. Likewise, there are many informal enterprises that provide cheap raw materials and labour to the organised segment, thereby making their livelihood contingent on demand from the latter. This is especially true for Indian manufacturing \u2014increasing competition due to openness increases the pressure to reduce costs. This, along with strict labour regulations, provides an ideal scenario for extensive sub -contracting (Mazumdar and Sarkar, 2008; Ramaswamy, 1999). There are two contending views about the nature of sub-contracting: the stagnation view, where formal enterprises subcontract to informal labor-intensive units to minimize labor costs, and the modernization view, where formal enterprises establish sub-contracts with informal enterprises capable of using modern technology to ensure minimum standards in quality."

    "output": "This chapter adopts the approach of using the Employment-Unemployment Survey (EUS) and Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) data directly to estimate employment in both organized and unorganized segments of the 13 KLEMS manufacturing industries. This estimation is done with the help of questions related to enterprise type and the number of workers. Specifically, the organized sector includes workers in public sector enterprises, semi-public enterprises, and other units covered under the Annual Survey of Industries (ASI). For the 61st and 68th EUS, if units covered under ASI are not separately coded, information is obtained through responses on the use of electricity and the number of workers employed. Workers in enterprises with more than 10 workers using electricity or more than 20 workers without electricity are included in organized sector employment. This methodology is applied to unit-level data from NSS rounds starting from 1999-2000 and PLFS (2017-18), as consistent informality characteristics data is available from EUS only from 1999 onwards."

    "output": "The real GVA series for the organised and unorganised segments of the manufacturing industries were constructed first at current prices and then deflated to obtain the series at 2011-12 prices, using the implicit deflators for GVA series for the 13 manufacturing industries in the India KLEMS database 2019. The series at current prices for the organised segment was constructed first for each industry for the years 1980 to 2011. Then, for each industry, a series on GVA at current prices was formed on the basis of ASI data for the years 1980 to 2017. The series available till 2011, was then extended to 2017 with the help of the series prepared using ASI data (using the regression technique). Having obtained the GVA series for the organised segment, then, that for the unorganised segment has been derived as residual. Certain problems were encountered when this method was applied in the case of one of the industries, namely \u2018coke, refined petroleum products and nuclear fuel\u2019. For that industry, a slightly different method has been applied for obtaining estimates of GVA at current prices for organised and unorganised segments for the years 2011 to 2017, as explained in Annexure 8A."

    "output": "The first term in equation 8.3 refers to the productivity level of the aggregate manufacturing sector in the absence of informality, while the second term represents the cost due to the presence of informality, which is expected to be negative because labor productivity in the unorganized segment of an industry is typically lower than in the organized segment. Equation (8.4), which is derived by differentiating equation (8.3) with respect to time, shows the drag on the aggregate labor productivity growth of manufacturing due to the presence of the unorganized segment as follows:\n\n\ud835\udc66\u0302\ud835\udc61 = \n1\n\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc61\u22121  \u2211 \u2206\ud835\udc5b\n\ud835\udc57=1 (\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc57,\ud835\udc61 \ud835\udc66  \ud835\udc57,\ud835\udc61\n\ud835\udc39 )  +  \n1\n\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc61\u22121 \u2211 \u2206\ud835\udc5b\n\ud835\udc57=1 [\ud835\udc60 \ud835\udc57,\ud835\udc61 \ud835\udc3c \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc57,\ud835\udc61  (\ud835\udc66 \ud835\udc57,\ud835\udc61\n\ud835\udc3c \u2212 \ud835\udc66 \ud835\udc57,\ud835\udc61\n\ud835\udc39 )]\n\nwhere \ud835\udc66\u0302\ud835\udc61 is the growth rate in labor productivity. The drag depends on the difference between the labor productivity of the unorganized and organized segments, and on the share of the former within the sector (industry). The cost will be small if either one or both are small in magnitude. Because the share of informality within an industry is high in developing countries, the drag due to informality is also higher compared to developed countries where the share of informality is low."

    "input": "Question: What does equation (8.5) represent in the context of labor productivity, and how is the structural change component further decomposed?",
    "output": "Equation (8.5) decomposes annual change in labour productivity levels into within industry productivity change component and a structural change component. The first term in equation (8.5) is the within effect, or the effect of productivity change within the organised and unorganised segment of each industry. It denotes for each industry the sum of change in productivity levels weighted by its respective employment share in the previous period. The within manufacturing sector component captures not only intra-sectoral reallocation but also the technological and institutional improvements that might happen within the manufacturing sub -sectors. The second term is the between effect or structural change \u2014a measure of the effect traceable to workers reallocation across industries\u2014that is calculated by a change in employment weighted by levels of productivity. If it is positive, it suggests that workers move to sectors with above -average productivity levels , and this term is often considered as a static reallocation (or static between) effect and is also described as the structural-change term measuring the movement of workers from less productive to more productive industries. The structural change component (SC) of the equation (8.5) can be rewritten as SCt = \u2211 [\ud835\udc5b\n\ud835\udc57=1 \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc57,\ud835\udc61 \ud835\udc66 \ud835\udc57,\ud835\udc61\n\ud835\udc39 (\u2206\ud835\udc60 \ud835\udc57,\ud835\udc61\n\ud835\udc39 )+ \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc57,\ud835\udc61  \ud835\udc66 \ud835\udc57,\ud835\udc61\n\ud835\udc3c (\u2206\ud835\udc60 \ud835\udc57,\ud835\udc61\n\ud835\udc3c )] + \u2211 [\ud835\udc5b\n\ud835\udc57=1 \ud835\udc60 \ud835\udc57,\ud835\udc61\u22121\n\ud835\udc39 \ud835\udc66 \ud835\udc57,\ud835\udc61\n\ud835\udc39 (\u2206\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc57,\ud835\udc61 ) + \ud835\udc60  \ud835\udc57,\ud835\udc61\u22121\n\ud835\udc3c \ud835\udc66 \ud835\udc57,\ud835\udc61\n\ud835\udc3c (\u2206\ud835\udc60 \ud835\udc57,\ud835\udc61 )] which decomposes the structural change component into within and between segment labour reallocations. The first term on the right-hand side of Equation (8.6) expresses the impact of the workers (re)allocation within sub -sectors (13 manufacturing industries) of organised and unorganised segments. As such, this term will be non -zero if there are movements between the two segments within the subsectors. A negative value of the component implies that workers move, on average, from the more productive organised segments to the less productive unorganised segments within sub -sectors, and vice versa for a positive value."

    "input": "Question: What factors account for the importance of manufacturing in economic growth, and how has the consensus on manufacturing's role evolved?",
    "output": "Based on theoretical and empirical evidence, four underlying factors accounted for the importance of manufacturing in economic growth: (i) it is a source of capital accumulation (Szirmai, 2009), (ii) it offers greater opportunities of economies of scale (Kaldor, 1967), (iii) it is a source of advancement in technology (Cornwall, 1977), and (iv) it offers stronger backward and forward linkages (Dan and Yao, 2017) and spill over -effects between different sectors\u2014so higher productivity in manufacturing sector than in agricultural sector induces transfer of resources, especially labour from agriculture (Dan and Yao, 2017). While Mehrotra (2020) reiterated these important contributions of manufacturing, Sharma (2020, pp.12) mentioned that manufacturing generally has the biggest impact on the direction of the economy, because it has traditionally been the main source of jobs, innovation and increases in productivity. It is also asserted by many studies (Rodrik, 2013; Panagariya, 2008; Acharya et al., 2003) that for a developing country like India, it is important to maintain a high manufacturing growth without which the pace of growth of the service sector cannot be sustained\u2014and except for a few countries with abundant natural resources, almost all countries that sustained a high growth did so with the help of the manufacturing sector (Rodrik, 2013).\n\nHowever, the consensus in the old economic literature that manufacturing was the key to economic development is now questioned because advanced economies are now predominantly service economies, and the recent experiences of India and other emerging economies raise the question whether services have become the key sector in economic development in the twenty -first century (Szirmai, 2011) . The new economic literature (Timmer and de Vries, 2007) confirms the increase in importance of the service sector and shows that in advanced countries, service sectors now account for over two-thirds of GDP. This alone gives the service sector substantial weight in economic growth. The developing countries are also now characterised by a very large share of the service sector even at an early stage of development. Many of them did not follow the traditional linear sequence of a shift from agriculture to manufacturing, and a subsequent shift to services. There is evidence now, which suggests that even as deindustrialisation has taken place in the developed world (Rodrik, 2015), manufacturing is no longer growing even in the developing world. Rodrik (2015) finds evidence of an \u2018inverted U-shape\u2019 curve for manufacturing where its share first rises and then tends to fall over the course of economic development. Countries have reached \u2018peak manufacturing\u2019 in employment and value-added shares at a much earlier point."

    "input": "Question: What are the reasons and characteristics of premature deindustrialization in developing countries, and how does this phenomenon relate to the role of manufacturing and services in economic growth, particularly in the context of India?",
    "output": "Developing countries are experiencing \u2018premature deindustrialisation\u2019 (Palma, 2005 and Rodrik, 2015), where deindustrialization is more visible in the share of manufacturing in employment rather than in output. These countries are peaking in manufacturing employment at lower income levels, with shares in total employment lower than in the past (below 18 per cent compared to over 30 per cent, according to Felipe, et al., 2015). Two reasons for this are: (i) trade liberalization and internationalization of supply chains, increasing international competition and moving factory jobs to low-wage, less-productive countries; and (ii) technological change that is labor-saving. However, some studies find little change in the manufacturing sector\u2019s value-added and employment shares in world GDP due to a shift of manufacturing to more populous and less developed countries. Palma (2005) suggests potential hypotheses such as: (i) contracting out manufacturing jobs to services; (ii) a fall in the income elasticity of manufactures; (iii) higher productivity growth in manufacturing; (iv) global outsourcing; or (v) technological progress. Nayyar et al. (2018) attribute premature deindustrialisation to similar features of many service sectors as of manufacturing. Rodrik (2015) highlights that the consequence of deindustrialisation is service-led growth. Many services, such as IT and finance, are high productivity and tradable, and could play the escalator role that manufacturing has traditionally played. However, these service industries are typically highly skill \u2010intensive, and do not have the capacity to absorb \u2014as manufacturing did\u2014the type of labour that low \u2010 and middle\u2010income economies have in abundance. The bulk of other services suffer from two shortcomings. They are either technologically not very dynamic, or non \u2010tradable, which means their ability to expand rapidly is constrained by incomes (and hence productivity) in the rest of the economy.\n\nManufacturing in India occupied a key role in Indian development planning from the beginning of the Second Five Year Plan in 1956, and heavy industries, especially, were emphasized."

    "output": "In India, manufacturing acted as the engine of growth in the early 1970s and 1980s, slowing after the economic reforms of the 1990s because it was input-driven instead of efficiency-driven. Despite a decline in its share, manufacturing continued to act as the engine of growth post-1990s, driven mainly by factor accumulation rather than productivity growth. India experienced stagnation between 1991 and 2016, with manufacturing accounting for only 14-15% of GDP, compared to a higher share in many other Asian economies. Between 1999 and 2017, the manufacturing sector's share in real value added slightly increased from 15% to 18%, but remained stagnant at 11% in aggregate employment."

    "output": "Dhawan and Sengupta (2020) suggest that Indian manufacturing could still become an engine of both economic growth and jobs if it can specialise in and participate in global value chains of the 11 sectors where it has a comparative advantage. They argue that it can be done, among other things, by focussing on four market opportunities: export growth, import substitution with localisation, domestic demand, and contract manufacturing. They advocate appropriate policy interventions, such as, (i) raising the productivity of labour and capital with better infrastructure, logistics, product quality, branding, and packaging, (ii) accessing capital \u2014domestic and foreign, and (iii) getting know -how and technology. Gandhi and Chaudhary (2020) have also argued that India can become a global manufacturing hub and compete with China if its competitiveness is enhanced with reforms related to infrastructure, logistics, labour, land, contract enforcement, and dispute resolution, etc. Mehrotra (2020) attributes the stagnation in manufacturing to the absence of a coherent industrial policy since 1991 and argues for an appropriate strategy to address the concerns of all enterprises\u2014large, small and medium, and micro. Suresh (2017) highlights the importance of high technology industries in Indian manufacturing, while discussing aerospace, pharmaceuticals, and automotive, as India\u2019s successes and telecommunication equipment as an unsuccessful case. Chanda (2018) emphasises the importance of interdependence between the manufacturing and the services sector, while designing any policy to boost manufacturing. It is also important to recognize that it has a dualistic structure with the prevalence of organized and unorganized sectors. Though the share of unorganized sector in employment is still large, but it has declined in the recent period. The increase in manufacturing employment between 1999 and 2017 has been observed more in the organized sector (7 million) than in the unorganized sector (3 million). Thus, the growth in employment in the manufacturing in the unorganized sector remained stagnant."

    "input": "Question: What does the study reveal about informality in India's manufacturing sector, and what are some key observations?",
    "output": "The study reveals that informality in India\u2019s manufacturing is not only dominant but also persistent. The unorganised sector contributes about one-third to the total manufacturing value added in both 1999-00 and 2017-18, while its share in total employment in manufacturing is more than 60 per cent despite declining during this period. Additionally, 2.6 million persons were employed in the unorganised sector during this period, out of an overall increase by nearly 10 million persons in total manufacturing employment. Organised sector employment is only 34 per cent of the total manufacturing employment in 2017-18. There is variability in the degree of informality among the 13 manufacturing industries in India, with the share of the unorganised sector in both total value-added and employment being more than 90 per cent in Wood and Wood Products throughout 1999-2017, while in value added it is almost nil for the Coke and Petroleum Products industry despite a substantial 26 per cent share in employment in 2017. The dominance of the unorganised sector in employment (80 per cent or more) is evident in the traditional labour industries (sub-sectors of manufacturing) of Food Products, Beverages and Tobacco, Textiles and Leather, Wood and Wood Products, and Other manufacturing (Manufacturing n.e.c.; recycling), and it is less prominent (less than 35 per cent in 2017) in the non-traditional industries of Coke and Petroleum Products, Chemicals and Chemical Products, and Transport Equipment. Promotion of these non-traditional industries may help in \u2018formalisation\u2019 of the manufacturing sector. India, therefore, needs sector-specific industrial strategies, alongside approaches for addressing the general problems of poor infrastructure, uncertain electricity supply, access to credit, etc."

    "output": "This section presents a comparative analysis of real GVA growth in the organised and unorganised segments of 13 manufacturing industries and analyses patterns for the periods 1980-2017, and 1999-2017. Table 8.3 shows that during 1981-2017, the average annual growth rate in real GVA in total manufacturing was about 6.7 per cent, while it was 7.2 per cent for organised manufacturing and about 6 per cent for unorganised manufacturing. On examining the sub-periods, the growth rate in real GVA in organised manufacturing (7.6 per cent) significantly exceeded that in unorganised manufacturing (3.6 per cent) during 1981-93, i.e., the pre-reforms period. This gap in growth rates in real GVA narrowed down significantly in the next sub-period, 1994-2002, but widened once again during 2003-07, a period of high growth in the Indian economy. Interestingly, during 2008-17, the sub-period bearing the impact of global economic slowdown, it was unorganised manufacturing that registered a higher growth in real GVA than the organised segment. While there was a marked slowdown in the growth rate in real GVA in organised manufacturing in the period 2008-17 as compared with 2003-07, there was acceleration in the growth rate in real GVA in unorganised manufacturing, going up from 7.22 per cent per annum to 8.45 per cent per annum. Consistent with these growth rates, the share of organised manufacturing in real GVA of total manufacturing rose between 1980 and 2007 and declined between 2007 and 2017. The share of organised manufacturing in aggregate real GVA of manufacturing rose from about 55 per cent in 1980 to about 67 per cent in 1993 and further to about 69 per cent in 2003 and about 71 per cent in 2007. It subsequently rose to about 74 per cent in 2011 and then came down to about 66 per cent by 2017. During 2012-17, the growth rate in real GVA in unorganised manufacturing significantly exceeded that in organised manufacturing causing a marked fall in the relative share of the organised segment in the real GVA of total manufacturing."

    "output": "During 2000-2017, the growth rate in real GVA was relatively higher in the unorganised segment than the organised segment in Chemicals and Chemical Products, Rubber and Plastic Products, Electrical and Optical Equipment, and Transport Equipment, with a gap of more than two percentage points per annum.\nTaking all manufacturing industries together, the annual growth rate in real GVA in the organised segment at 7.26 per cent during 2000-2017 was almost the same as that in the unorganised segment (7.17 per cent). The growth rate in the organised segment significantly decelerated from 8.49 per cent in 2000-2007 to 6.29 per cent during 2008-17. In the unorganised segment, by contrast, the annual growth rate in real GVA accelerated over the same period, going up from 5.57 per cent during 2000-2007 to 8.45 per cent during 2008-17.\nIndustry-wise comparison of growth rates in real GVA for the same duration reveals that within the organised segment, the growth rate fell in the latter period in seven industries out of 13 and increased in the remaining six industries, of which a marked increase is noticed in two cases: Rubber and Plastic Products and Other manufacturing (Manufacturing, n.e.c. including recycling). For the unorganised segment, the growth rate in real GVA was relatively higher during 2008-17 than that during 2000-2007 in eight industries out of 13. Relatively larger acceleration in GVA growth rate occurred in Wood and Wood Products, Chemicals and Chemical Products, Rubber and Plastic Products, Non-Metallic Mineral Products, Transport Equipment and Other manufacturing (Manufacturing, n.e.c. including recycling).\nThe period 2008-17 bore the impact of global economic slowdown. The growth rate in real GVA in Indian manufacturing fell from 9.08 per cent per annum during 2003-07 to 6.96 per cent during 2008-17 (Table 8.3). Comparing the two periods 2000-2007 and 2008-17, the annual growth rate in real GVA in Indian manufacturing fell from 7.57 per cent to 6.96 per cent (Table 8.4). A similar fall in the growth rate in real GVA in aggregate organised segment is evident in both Tables 8.3 and 8.4. Remarkably, however, the unorganised segment of Indian manufacturing did not experience a slowdown in the period 2008-17\u2014 its growth accelerated not only at the aggregate level but also in the unorganised segments of a majority of the industries.\nTo verify the trends in GVA growth in unorganised manufacturing indicated by Tables 8.3 and 8.4, an analysis of trends in GVA growth in the household segment of Indian manufacturing was undertaken. The real GVA series for the household segment for the years 2011-12 to 2017-18 is available in the NAS series with 2011-12 as the base year. This has been extended backward to 1999-2000 by using the back series corresponding to the NAS series with base 2011-12. The back series provided data on real GVA for organised and unorganised segments of manufacturing, which seems to be corresponding to the corporate and household segments respectively. From the real GVA series (at 2011-12 prices) for the household segment thus obtained, the average annual growth rates are found to be 5.9 per cent during 2000-2007 and 8.2 per cent during 2008-17. These are quite similar to the growth rates reported in 143"

This corroborates the pattern observed in Tables 8.3 and 8.4 in respect of real GVA growth in unorganised manufacturing.

    "output": "Table 8.5 presents the average annual growth rates in employment, in percent per annum, for organized and unorganized segments of Indian manufacturing from 2000-2017, broken down by sub-period. For All manufacturing, the average annual growth rate in employment was 2.72% (2000-2017), 4.76% (2000-2007), and 1.09% (2008-2017) for the organized segment, while the unorganized segment had growth rates of 0.46% (2000-2017), 1.61% (2000-2007), and -0.45% (2008-2017).

This fall in the growth rate in manufacturing e mployment seems to be attributable at least in part to the global economic slowdown. The global financial crisis in 2008 led to for a strong preference for deglobalisation and economic protectionism, leading to the rise in tariffs and a reduction in intern ational trade, which, in turn, had an adverse effect on growth. As Table 8.4 has already shown, the growth rate in real GVA in organised manufacturing declined significantly during 2008 -17 compared with 2000 -2007. Since the organised segment was the prime contributor to employment growth in manufacturing during 2000-2007, the decline in its output growth, would have affected employment growth as well. However, the growth rate in employment in organised manufacturing has declined much more than the growth r ate in real GVA \u2014therefore there would be other factors causing the deceleration in employment. One possible factor could be growing capital intensity of production induced by changes in factor prices."

    "output": "In this section we first explain the behaviour of labour productivity followed by its decomposition. Labour productivity growth rate has been computed by the difference of growth rate of real value added and growth rate of persons employed by UPSS.\n\nThe trends in the level of labor productivity for aggregate manufacturing and for its organized and unorganized segments for 1999-2017 are presented in Figure 8.2. It shows that the organized segment consistently has a higher level of labor productivity than the unorganized and while the absolute gap between the two has widened over the years, the relative gap has narrowed down from a multiple of six to a multiple of four, indicating some convergence in labor productivity. The figure also reveals that the labor productivity of aggregate manufacturing is dragged down by the unorganized sector and broadly follows its trend, because of its dominance in total manufacturing in terms of employment.\n\nAverage annual growth rates in labour productivity in the organised and unorganised segments and total manufacturing during 2000 to 2017 and the two sub-periods 2000-2007 and 2008-17 are depicted in Figure 8.3. It shows that the growth rate in labour prod uctivity was higher in the unorganised segment than in the organised during 2000-2017 as well as in the two sub-periods. It is particularly interesting to observe a marked increase in the annual growth rate in labour productivity in the unorganised segment to 8.9 per cent in 2008-17 from 4 per cent in 2000-2007. As observed earlier unorganised manufacturing experienced a marked increase in the growth rate in real GVA and a fall in the growth rate of employment during 2008-17 as compared to 2000-2007. A mark ed increase in the growth rate in labour productivity is therefore expected. Interestingly, although the growth rate in real GVA in organised manufacturing declined significantly during 2008 -17 compared with 2000 -2007, the growth rate in labour productivity in this segment also declined but by less than that in the unorganised segment."

    "output": "From 1999 to 2017, labor productivity in total manufacturing experienced faster growth in the period 2008-17 due to a steeper decline in employment growth rate even though the real GVA in organised manufacturing decreased. Productivity in the unorganised sector is generally less than that in the organised sector. Between 1999 and 2017, the productivity of the organised sector increased and was about Rs 800,000 in 2017 as compared to only about Rs 200,000 for the unorganised sector. Over this period, although the absolute difference in labor productivity increased, the overall tendency for labor productivity in the two segments was of convergence, and the ratio of labor productivity of the two narrowed from a multiple of 5.7 to a multiple of just 3.9. While the differences in labor productivity between the segments were small for some industries in 2017 for others, these differences were very substantial, e.g., in Food products, beverages and tobacco; Paper & paper products; Coke and petroleum products; and Machinery, n.e.c. The major reason for the variation could be differences in the enterprise-level production structures in the two segments. The industries with above average labor productivity in the organised segment in 1999-2000, are Coke and petroleum products, Chemicals and chemical products, Rubber and plastic products, Basic metals and metal products, Machinery, n.e.c. and Transport equipment. In 2017-18, five of these six industries except Chemicals and chemical products still enjoyed above average labor productivity. On comparison with the unorganised segment, there is variation in the gap between the labor productivity in the organised and unorganised segments. While the difference in labor productivity in 1999-2000 between the two segments is more than five times in Basic metals and metal products, it is just one and a half times for Electrical and optical equipment. In 2017-18, the difference in labor productivity between the  two segments was 7.5 times for Food products, beverages and tobacco, but in the Transport equipment industry, and Wood and wood product industry, labor productivity in the unorganised segment was more than that in the organised segment. Over the period of 1999 to 2017, the convergence, visible at the aggregate level manufacturing sector, is also visible in eight out of 13 manufacturing industries\u2014Chemicals and chemical products, Rubber and plastic products, and Other manufacturing"

    "output": "Convergence in labour productivity was experienced in Manufacturing, n.e.c.; recycling due to a rapid increase in labour productivity in the unorganised segment. In the other five industries, where divergence in the labour productivity is observed over time, four of them \u2014 Food products, beverages and tobacco, Paper and paper products, Coke and petroleum products, and Basic metals and metal products failed to achieve convergence between the organised and unorganised segments due to a large increase in labour productivity in the former. There is thus a tendency in a majority of the manufacturing industries, for convergence in labour productivity between the organised and the unorganised segments. This kind of catching up in labour productivity is possible only when the unorganised segment achieves a faster growth in labour productivity, which requires appropriate policy support."

    "output": "Figure 8.4 shows labour productivity of the organised and unorganised segments relative to the aggregate industry and reveals the heterogeneity that exists among the 13 industries of the manufacturing sector. In only one industry\u2014Transport equipment\u2014labour productivity in the unorganised segment was almost equal to that of the aggregate industry and had the least gap with labour productivity in the organised segment. A plausible explanation for this lies in the predominance of organised employment (more than 75 per cent) in the industry (Figure 8.5). However, barring the exception of Transport equipment, labour productivity in the organised segment of each industry is higher than that in its unorganised counterpart, with large gaps in some cases, e.g., Food products, beverages and tobacco, Electrical and optical equipment, Machinery, n.e.c., Basic metals and metal products, and Coke and petroleum products. It is clear from Figure 8.5 that in all these industries except Coke and petroleum products, the unorganised sector\u2019s share in employment is quite high at 50 per cent or more, and this large unorganised segment has low labour productivity. The information in Figure 8.5 on the average shares of unorganised and organised segments in total employment at the industry level reveals that unorganised sector employment dominates in relatively traditional and low-tech industries\u2014Food products, beverages and tobacco, Textiles and leather, Wood and wood products, Non-metallic mineral products, Basic metals and metal products, and Other manufacturing (Manufacturing, n.e.c. including recycling). The organised segment\u2019s share in employment is relatively high in the more high-tech industries, e.g., in Transport equipment, Machinery, n.e.c., Rubber and plastic products, Chemicals and chemical products, and Coke and petroleum products."

    "output": "In section 8.7.2, the report tries to understand how the persistence of employment in the unorganised sector acts as a dampener in the growth of overall labour productivity and whether any movement of labour from less -productive employment to more -productive employment could increase productivity and hence income level of workers. Figures 8.2 and 8.4 have revealed that the overall average manufacturing labour productivity and that of the 13 industries is lower in the unorganised sector despite its dominance in terms of employment in most industries. The report aims to know the extent to which the unorganised sector \u2018drags\u2019 down the labour productivity of the organised sector. Equation 8.4 is used to find the \u2018drag\u2019, with the results presented in Table 8.7, showing a substantial \u2018drag\u2019 over the period 2000-2017\u2014more than 25 per cent of the aggregate productivity growth without informality. This drag is slightly more in the second sub-period of 2008-17, when the aggregate labour productivity of the manufacturing sector increased by 2 percentage points. The explanation for the bigger \u2018drag\u2019 in the period 2008-2017 lies in the fact that while labour productivity of the unorganised sector during the two sub-periods grew faster and narrowed down the relative gap between the two segments, the absolute gap in the levels of labor productivity of the two segments has increased."

    "input": "Question: What does Table 8.8 reveal about the decomposition of productivity growth in the manufacturing sector, and what were the contributions of the organized and unorganized sectors?",
    "output": "Table 8.8 provides the magnitude of the reallocation effects \u2013 both within-industry productivity growth and static or structural change in the manufacturing sector. The average aggregate productivity growth for the entire period of 2000-2017 is 6.4 per cent, 5.3 per cent in the first sub-period (2000-2007) and 7.2 per cent in the second sub-period (2008-2017). In general, aggregate productivity growth is explained majorly by within-industry productivity growth (5.2 per cent out of 6.4 per cent for 2000-2017), and the remaining part (1.2 per cent) is attributed to between effect or structural change. The impact of overall reallocation has thus been throughout positive. The structural change effect was lower during the earlier period and increased substantially since 2008. Some of the reforms aimed at mitigating the adverse impact of the global financial crisis in 2008 might have incentivised these structural changes. Some positive outcomes of the development of global value chains and access to ICT might also have induced these structural changes.\n\nThe contributions of organised and unorganised manufacturing to the within-industry productivity change and to structural change are shown in columns 1, 2, 4, and 5 of Table 8.8. The organised sector contributed more than 60 per cent to within-industry change during the period 2000-2017, although this share declined slightly in the second sub-period as compared with the first. The structural change in total manufacturing, although small, came from the organised sector\u2014where workers moved from less productive industries to more productive industries. The contribution by the unorganised sectors on the other hand, is negative for the first sub-period, small and positive for the second sub-period, but negative for the overall period. This implies that labour either moved from more productive organised to less productive unorganised sectors, or from more productive unorganised to less productive unorganised sectors. The results are consistent with the results by Djidonou and McGregor (2020) for the period 1981-2011."

    "input": "Question: According to the decomposition of effects between organized and unorganized segments from 2000-2017, what are the key trends in structural change within and across industries?",
    "output": "For the period 2000-2017, the total structural change is positive in both sub-periods (2000-2007 and 2008-2017) and can be attributed to both within-industry and across-industry structural change. The contribution of within-industry structural change is positive in the first sub-period and this offsets the small negative change in the cross-industry sectoral change. However, the cross-industry structural change subsequently contributed substantially and has offset the negative within-industry structural change, resulting in the overall positive structural change.\n\nConsidering the decomposition of the effects between the organised and unorganised segments, the results show that the within-industry component is negative for the unorganised sector while the cross-industry structural change component is overall positive, albeit small\u2014negative for first sub-period and positive for the second sub-period in this study. This means that one of the drivers of the relatively low structural change component has been the shift of employment within industries to less productive unorganised activities. While there has also been a movement towards more organised industries over time, this has not been large enough to offset the move to unorganised activities within industries. Conversely, the within and cross industries structural change components are positive for the organised segment for the entire period, but negative for within -industry structural change in the second sub-period and cross -industry change in the first sub-period 2000-2007\u2014suggesting that overall, there has been structural change both within and across industries towards more productive organised activities. For the unorganised sector, the within-industry structural change is negative but the between-industry structural change is positive. It is thus obvious that while there has been some structural change within industries towards less productive unorganised activities, but when we consider cross industry movements, the workers are moving to more productive unorganised segments. It is indeed heartening to note that workers are moving not only from less productive unorganised segments to more productive organised segments within an industry, but also across industries from less productive to more productive industries. This process may help in the overall formalisation of the manufacturing industry and in increasing its productivity."

    "output": "The construction of real GVA series for organised and unorganised segments of the 13 KLEMS industries belonging to manufacturing involves several steps, as follows:\n\nA. The computations start from the GVA series at current prices for the 13 KLEMS manufacturing industries (organised and unorganised segments combined) as given in India KLEMS database, 2019. These series are for the years 1980 to 2017 and are based on the NAS series with base 2011-12 and the corresponding back series.\n\nB. The GVA series at constant (2011 -12) prices for different industries are also taken from India KLEMS database, 2019 and implicit deflators for GVA are computed for each of the 13 manufacturing industries.\n\nC. In the next step, GVA at current prices are constructed separately for the organised and unorganised segments of the 13 industries for the years 1980 to 2011 on the basis of national accounts data with base 2004 -05 and the corresponding back series. Using GVA data for manufacturing industries available in the NAS series with base 2004-05 and the corresponding back series, GVA for the organised (registered) and unorganised (unregistered) segments of each of the 13 KLEMS manufacturing industries have been obtained for the years 1980 to 2011. These series are not directly use, but are used to split proportionately the series mentioned in (A) above into organised and unorganised components, for the years 1980 to 2011. \n\nD. Using ASI data, GVA at current prices is computed for each of the 13 manufacturing industries. Such series have been constructed for the years 1980 to 2017. ASI based GVA series is the organised segment for each of the 13 manufacturing industries.\n\nE. For each industry, the GVA series for the organised segment constructed in step -C is regressed on the series based on ASI (as in step -D) for the period 1999 to 2011 and then the estimated regression coefficient along with the ASI based series for the years 2012 to 2017 are used to extend the series for the organised segment obtained in step -C for the years 2012 to 2017. After computing GVA at current prices for the organised segment, that for the unorganised segment is obtained as residual (since total GVA is available for each industry each year from step A).\n\nF. However, in the case of one industry, namely \u2018Coke, Refined Petroleum Products and Nuclear fuel\u2019, the method described above encountered a problem. In the national accounts data with base 2011 -12, GVA for manufacturing industries are split into two parts: corporate.  In the NAS series with base 2011-12, separate estimates of GVA are available for the corporate segment and the household segment of manufacturing industries. The coverage of the corporate segment is greater than the organised segment, as defined here, because a part of the unorganised segment gets included under the corporate segment (as a component of quasi-corporate).  The coverage of the household segment is accordingly less than that of the un organised segment. This information on GVA in the household segment of different industries is made use of in step-F. Also NSO made a correction to ASI data for 2011 -12 in January 2016. In the NAS 2004 -05 series, the corresponding correction was not made since the NSO meanwhile shifted to a new NAS series with base 2011-12. In preparing the data series for this study, this correction in ASI data was incorporated.  The correction affects the estimates of value added for two industries: (i) chemicals and chemical products and (ii) basic metals and fabricated metal products."

    "output": "The construction of the real GVA series for organised and unorganised segments of the 13 KLEMS industries belonging to manufacturing involves several steps, including using GVA series at current and constant prices from the India KLEMS database, constructing GVA at current prices separately for organized and unorganized segments, computing GVA using ASI data, and regressing GVA series for the organised segment. However, in the case of 'Coke, Refined Petroleum Products and Nuclear fuel', the computed GVA for the unorganised segment was found to be less than that reported for the household segment in the national accounts data (with base 2011 -12) for the year 2011-12 and for some later years.  For 2011-12, the figure for household segment was treated as the estimate for the unorganised sector. For the years 2012 -13 to 2017 -18, an estimate of GVA for the unorganised segment was formed by taking the GVA figures for the household segment (available in NAS, base 2011 -12) and multiplying it by a scale -up factor. The scale -up factor was formed by considering the GVA figures for household segment for the years 2007-08 to 2011-12 and the estimate for the unorganised segment made in step-E above (the latter divided by the former, after taking the annual average). Having obtained the estimates of GVA in the unorganised segment for the years 2011 -12 to 2017 -18, an estimate for the organised segment for these years was derived as residual (since the total GVA of the industry, organised and unorganised segments combined is known in step A). After obtaining GVA series at current prices for the organised and unorganised segments for each of the 13 manufacturing industries for the years 1980-81 to 2017-18, these were deflated to derive GVA at 2011-12 prices using deflators mentioned in step-B."

Two interesting points emerge from it. First, in some of the industries, the average annual growth rate in real GVA during 1981-2017 was higher in the unorganised segment than in the organised segment, even though at the aggregate level, the growth rate in real GVA in the latter exceeds that in the former. This pattern is observed for Rubber and plastic products, Electrical and optical equipment and Transport equipment. Evidently, in these three industries, the relative share of the unorganised segment in real GVA of the industry had an upward trend. Second, even though at the aggregate level of unorganised manufacturing, real GVA grew faster during 2008-17 than in 2003-07, for several industries, the growth rate in GVA fell in 2008-17. Further, there was a marked increase in the GVA growth rate between the periods 2003-07 and 2008-17 in the unorganised segment of Rubber and plastic products and Transport equipment, and this tended to pull up the growth rate at the aggregate level of unorganised manufacturing in the latter period."

However, the growth rate in employment in the organised segment was significantly higher in the period 2000-2017 (2.72%) than in the period 1981-1999 (0.23%), whereas the converse was true for the unorganised segment of manufacturing where a marked slowdown in employment growth took place in the later period (2.54% vs 0.46%). As regards total manufacturing, the growth rate in employment during 2000-2017 at about 1.1 per cent per annum was lower than that during 1981-1999 at about 2.0 percent per annum.

    "output": "This chapter analyzes the trends in capital intensity \u2013 capital to worker ratio and capital to output ratio, focusing more on the trends in capital-labor ratio for two reasons: (1) this has implications for growth in labor productivity and TFP, and (2) this may have implications for employment generation. Capital deepening can augment labor by assisting workers and helping them improve their productivity. However, raising capital per worker may also lead to increasing substitution of workers with machines leading to adverse employment effects. Therefore, it is important for a country like India, with a significantly large number of young labor market entrants, to understand the trends in capital per worker. Capital intensity, or capital deepening, measured as capital stock per worker, has been increasing quite rapidly in the aggregate economy, especially since 2008. This has been true for both equipment capital stock (machinery and transport equipment assets) as well as non-equipment capital stock (construction). At the same time, the capital-output ratio, measured as capital stock per unit of real value-added, had been falling until the early 1990s and then started increasing. Despite some decline in the last two years since 2015, the general trend has been of growth. However, there are significant asset compositional differences here. While the capital to output ratio has been falling for non-equipment assets, it has been expanding for equipment, indicating the increasing mechanization of production in the economy. All analyses in this Chapter are done for the period 1981 (1981-1982) to 2017 (2017-2018) and three sub-periods, 1981-1993, 1994-2002, and 2003-2017.

    "output": "The aggregate picture presented above conceals several sectoral heterogeneities. For instance, the capital-worker ratio is relatively high in the utility sector and substantially low in agriculture and construction (Table 9.1). However, the capital intensity increased in all the seven broad sectors of the economy, including agriculture. For instance, it increased by about two times in agriculture, manufacturing, and services \u2014 both market and non-market, in the 2000s compared with the 1990s. The construction and mining sectors witnessed an even more rapid increase in the capital deepening rates. These trends suggest that the Indian economy is increasingly becoming capital intensive, and the rate of increase in capital per worker has been quite substantial over the last three decades. This is further established in Table 9.2, which depicts the average growth rates of capital intensity across the broad sectors of the economy. On average, the capital per worker ratio in the aggregate economy increased faster in the 2000s, at an average rate of 6.7 per cent compared with 2-4 per cent in the 1980s and the 1990s.

    "output": "In the 1980s, mining, manufacturing and utility sectors were the main drivers of the economy\u2019s capital deepening growth. In contrast, the increase in capital per worker ratio was very trivial in the services and agriculture sectors. In fact, the ratio contracted for the construction sector. During the 1990s, however, it was construction sector that saw the highest expansion in capital per worker while manufacturing sustained a growth rate of about 5 per cent. Other sectors where the growth rate of capital per worker improved are agriculture and non -market services, while the market services continued to see a weak growth rate. In the 2000s, most sectors improved their capital per worker -expansion rate from the 1990s, although the growth rate differed considerably across sectors. Construction saw a fall in the growth rate, although it still had one of the highest growth rates among the broad sectors. Agriculture, mining, and market services sectors have seen faster growth.\nOn the contrary, the capital/output ratio grew more moderately in most sectors across the entire period of study. In the 1980s, when the capital per worker ratio in the aggregate economy grew by 2.5 per cent, the capital -output ratio decelerated, suggesting that output grew faster than capital stock. Barring mining, manufacturing, and construction sectors, the other broad sectors had a negative growth rate. The situation changed in the 1990s, when mining, utility, and market services saw substantial contraction in the capital-output ratio, while the other sectors registered expansion, although at dismal rates in most cases. Construction was the sole sector that registered very high growth during this period. Overall, the economy did not see much expansion in the capital-output ratio. By the 2000s, however, almost all sectors, except manufacturing, had a positive capital-output ratio, indicating that capital outgrew output in most sectors, with the entire economy seeing just half a per cent average growth rate. The mining and construction sectors experienced the fastest expansion in their capital-output ratios.\nThese observations reinforce that the Indian economy has been becoming increasingly capital intensive over the years. The amount of capital that workers work with has been going up substantially across all sectors. The capital -output ratio has been growing likewise, although at a slower pace, and as a more recent phenomenon. Overall, it appears that among the broad sectors of the economy, construction is the one that is increasingly becoming capital intensive, both in terms of capital per worker as well as capital per output. It may be noted that, interestingly, this is also a sector where productivity growth, both labour productivity and total factor productivity, has been very dismal compared with most other sectors (Erumban et al., 2019). This suggests that although the sector has become increasingly capital intensive, its ability to use those assets more productively may have been limited."

    "output": "The fact that the capital-output ratio is rising, although at a slower pace than capital per worker, is indicative of weakening productivity of capital across Indian industries. Indeed, the economy is becoming increasingly capital intensive, but the question remains whether those investments are productively used or efficiently allocated. The rise in the capital-output ratio will directly impact labour productivity, as workers are now left to work with more capital (machines, for instance). In the standard Cobb-Douglas production function, under strict assumptions of constant returns to scale, labour productivity is a direct function of total factor productivity and capital per worker. Following that rationale, the growth accounting approach, widely used in the KLEMS type of research, can decompose the contribution of capital per worker and TFP within the accounting framework, which is attempted in a later chapter (see, for e.g., Erumban and van Ark, 2018)."

    "output": "Capital intensity grew faster during 1994-2002 than during 1981-1993 in 16 of the 27 industries. It grew at a faster pace during 2003-2007 than during 1994-2002 in 18 of the 27 industries. Thus, in two-thirds of the industries, the growth rate in capital intensity went up during 2003-2007, which was a period of high growth in the Indian economy. However, the growth rate in capital intensity in the more recent period 2008-2017 was higher than that during 2003-2007 in only eight out of the 27 industries\u2014in fact, it declined in a majority of the industries. Yet, the growth rate in capital intensity at the aggregate economy level was higher during 2008-2017 than that during 2003-2007, which could in part be a consequence of compositional changes. Of course, the growth in capital intensity in some of those eight industries where it rose, was sharp enough to have pulled up the aggregate level. Consider, for instance, the sharp rise in annual growth in capital intensity between the two sub-periods from 1.2 per cent to 13.3 per cent in Post & Telecommunication and from 9.8 per cent to 17 per cent in Trade (see Table 9.3). Generally, the industries that had a relatively higher growth rate in capital intensity during 2003-2007 also had a relatively higher growth rate in capital intensity during 2008-2017. However, there are exceptions. In Machinery nec, the growth rate in capital intensity was high during 2003-2007, but not during 2008-2017. On the other hand, in Post & telecommunication, there was slow growth in capital intensity during 2003-2007, but a rapid growth in capital intensity during 2008-2017.\n\nThe results of the decomposition analysis show that within-industry, increases in capital per worker generally sustained a relatively higher contribution to the economy-wide capital deepening growth rate. However, the static reallocation effect, which captures the effect of the movement of workers to industries with a relatively higher level of capital intensity, contributed about 38 per cent of the aggregate level capital intensity growth rate during 1981-1993. Evidently, inter-industry reallocation of labor (shifts of factors from labor intensive to capital intensive industries) contributed significantly to aggregate level capital intensity growth. The static reallocation effect was relatively smaller during 1994-2002, at 15 per cent, but it rose to 24 per cent during the period, 2003-2017. Notably, the aggregate level capital intensity growth."

During the same period, the growth rate in capital intensity increased in 18 out of 27 industries. A sizeable part (about one-third) of the hike in the growth rate in capital intensity in this duration (between 1994-2002 and 2003-2017) is explained by the effect of the inter-industry reallocation of labor. However, the contribution of the within-industry effect to the growth rate in capital intensity during 2003-2017 significantly exceeded that during 1994-2002 and was indeed a far more important factor explaining the hike."

    "input": "Question: How did the growth rate in real wages change between 1981-2002 and 2003-2017, and what does this indicate about the relationship between capital intensity, labor productivity, and real wages?",
    "output": "The growth rate in real (product) wage rate at the aggregate economy level was higher during 2003-2017 as compared with 1981-2002, showing the same pattern as capital intensity and labor productivity. The average annual growth rates in real (product) wage rate were 2.3 per cent for 1981-1993, 3.2 per cent for 1994-2002 and relatively much higher at 6.2 per cent for 2003-2017. This reflects a positive association over time among the growth rates in capital intensity, labor productivity, and real wages at the aggregate economy level. Interestingly, when the changes in the growth rates in capital intensity and labor productivity between the sub-periods 1994-2002 and 2003-2017 are considered at the industry level, a clear, strong positive association is not found. In 14 industries, capital intensity growth was higher during 2003-2017 than during 1994-2002 and the same holds for labour productivity. In 4 industries, there was a fall in the growth rate in capital intensity and this was accompanied by a fall in the growth rate in labour productivity. But, in the remaining 9 industries, a hike in the growth rate in capital intensity was not accompanied by an increase in the growth rate in labour productivity (examples: Basic Metals & Fabricated Metal Products; Hotel & Restaurants; and Post & Telecommunication) or a fall in the growth rate in capital intensity in the period was accompanied by a hike in the growth rate in labour productivity (examples: Non -metallic Mineral Products; and Rubber & Plastic Products). The explanation for these divergences lies in the growth rates in TFP achieved. The fact that in Basic Metals & Fabricated Metal Products; Hotel & Restaurants; and Post & Telecommunication, a hike in capital intensity growth rate during 2003-2017 did not translate into a hike in the growth rate in labour productivity is explained by a fall in the growth rate in TFP (value-added based). Similarly, the fact that in Non -metallic Mineral Products; and Rubber & Plastic Products, a fall in the growth rate in capital intensity during 2003-2017 did not result in a fall in the growth rate in labour productivity can be traced to an increase in the growth rate in TFP (value-added based). Along with the changes in the growth rates in capital intensity and labour productivity, the change in the growth rate in real (product) wage rate at the industry level between the periods 1994-2002 and 2003-2017 is also considered. The changes in the growth rates in real wage rate are highly correlated with those in labour productivity, with a correlation coefficient of 0.86. The correlation coefficient for changes in the growth rates in capital intensity and real (product) wage rate is found to be 0.24. While there are differences as well, at the aggregate economy level, the growth rate in real (product) wage rate was about 3.2 per cent per annum during 1994-2002 which went up to about 6.2 per cent during 2003-2017. A faster growth rate in real (product) wage rate during 2003-2017 was responsible, at least to some extent, for the hike that took place in the growth rate in capital intensity (and hence the growth rate in labour productivity) during 2003-2017."

    "input": "Question: According to the analysis, what was the relationship between the growth rate in real wages and the growth rate in capital intensity during 2003-2017, and how was this further investigated?",
    "output": "Considering the movements in the growth rates in capital intensity and real (product) wage rate between sub-periods (1994-2002 and 2003-2017) and considering also the industry-wise pattern revealed by Figure 9.3, it seems reasonable to argue that a relatively faster growth rate in real (product) wage rate during 2003-2017 was responsible, at least to some extent, for the hike that took place in the growth rate in capital intensity (and hence the growth rate in labour productivity) during 2003-2017. This receives further attention in the analysis carried out in the next section.\n\nTo probe this issue further, a regression analysis was undertaken using aggregate economy level time series data for the years 1980-1981 to 2017-2018. The model specification and regression results are reported in the next section. The results point towards a positive effect of the wage-rental ratio on capital intensity. It may be inferred accordingly that an increase in real wages and/or a lowering of cost of capital will tend to raise capital intensity. This is logical because if the price of one input (labour) goes up relative to another input (capital), then the former input will be substituted by producers by the latter input to reduce cost of production, and thus cause the ratio of capital to labour to rise. Thus, the results of the econometric analysis indicate that the finding of a marked increase in the growth rate in real wages during 2003-2017 as compared to 1981-2002 fits well with (and may be treated as a major explanation for) the finding of an accelerated growth in capital intensity in the Indian economy during 2003-2017."

The table shows the total economy indexed to 100. \nThe wage-rental ratio has increased over the years across the board, indicating that wages have increased much faster than the rental prices of capital.  The rate of increase in the market economy has been quite high in mining, market services, manufacturing, and utilities. Mining, utilities, and market services were also among those sectors with relatively higher wage/rental ratios compared with the aggregate economy. On the other hand, the wage-rental ratio for manufacturing was only 3/4th that of the entire economy. The aggregate economy-wide wage-rental ratios might have been heavily driven by the services sector, including the very high wage/rental ratio in the non-market services. In fact, all the broad sectors of the economy, except agriculture and manufacturing, had a higher-than-average wage rental ratio. The rising trend in wage-rental ratio across the board clearly indicates that capital has been becoming relatively cheaper for Indian industries over time."

In this estimation, K is measured by capital stock, and L is measured by the number of persons employed. The total wage bill is computed for each industry by multiplying the wage share in value added by gross value added at current prices, and then summed to derive the aggregate wage bill. This is divided by L to compute w. The total wage bill is subtracted from aggregate gross value added and then divided by K to compute r, and finally, the ratio of w to r is taken. A strong positive correlation between capital intensity and the wage-rental ratio is observed. To incorporate the impact of structural changes, particularly the share of the agriculture and allied sector in aggregate GVA, a slightly modified model (equation 9.2) has been estimated, including the share of the agriculture and allied sector in aggregate GVA as an additional explanatory variable."

Two estimates each are presented for the two equations\u2014one based on the ordinary least squares (OLS) method, the other based on Prais-Winsten regression. Since the DW statistic for the regression estimate based on OLS clearly indicates the presence of autocorrelation, which is likely to affect the parameter estimates, the Prais-Winsten regression has been applied.\n\nThe regression results presented in Table 9.7 clearly indicate a positive effect of wage-rental ratio on capital intensity (as expected), notwithstanding the fact that the results are affected by autocorrelation (as signified by the DW statistic). There is some indication that a structural shift from the agriculture sector to other sectors of the economy has had a positive effect on the capital intensity of the economy (i.e., it tends to raise capital intensity). It needs to be recognized that the econometric results in respect of the variable representing the agriculture sector share in aggregate GVA are weak, and the inference is based on the finding of a negative coefficient. Since, among various sectors of the economy, the agriculture sector is relatively more labor-intensive, a structural shift away from agriculture is obviously likely to reduce labor intensity and raise capital intensity. The regression results are in line with this expectation."

    "output": "In the equation (9.3), i is the subscript for industry, and t is the subscript for time (year); K denotes capital, L labor, w wage rate, and r or pK rental of capital input. The rental of capital input pK may be written as p I(\u03c0+\u03b4) where p I is the price (index) of investment (capital) goods (varies over time, but may be taken to be same for different industries), \u03c0 is the rate of interest applicable to the industry (varying over time) and \u03b4 is the rate of depreciation for the industry (it is based on the composition of capital assets, and it may be treated as time invariant), leading to equations 9.4, 9.5, and 9.6. The term w* denotes real wage rate (i.e., w/p Q), pI is the price of Investment (capital) goods, and pQ is the price of output. It is assumed that the terms \u03c0 and \u03b4 would vary across industries and time, and these variations are largely picked up by the industry dummies (\u03d5\u2019i) and year dummies (\u03bb\u2019t) in the model, which will also capture other industry specific effects as well as time specific effects. The equation has been estimated by applying the fixed effects model \u2013 for 1980-2017, and sub-periods. The results are shown in Table 9.8. A significant positive effect of real wages on capital intensity is found, implying thereby that hikes in real wages lead to increase in capital intensity. The coefficient of real wages which could be treated as the elasticity of substitution is found to be lower during 1980-1993 than that for 1994-2017. It appears that the labour-capital elasticity of substitution went up in the post-reform period. Section 9.4.2 notes that in the equation derived from the production function, K is used for capital input and L for labour input, for estimating the model derived therefrom, K is taken as capital stock and L as number of persons employed. This discrepancy is ignored, as the main econometric finding is unlikely to be impacted."

    "output": "The faster increase in the capital per worker in the economy also comes along with a rapid rise in the wage-rental ratio. The average wage per worker in India has increased much faster than the rental prices of capital, suggesting that capital is becoming relatively cheaper. Although there are variations in the change in the wage-rental ratio, the rapid increase is a reality across all sectors. Perhaps, the faster rise in the capital per worker across the board may be explained by the falling relative price of capital.\n\nFuture research may consider exploring what drives capital accumulation in the Indian economy. While we provide a general overview of the relative price of capital (compared to labour), several factors might be driving the decline in capital prices. For instance, the rapid declines in ICT prices have contributed to the increased investment in ICT assets globally since the 1990s. In general, innovation in the capital -producing sector - globally or locally - may have a direct or indirect effect on capital accumulation, as they can affect the relative price of equipment capital, indicating spillover effects from R&D spending on capital accumulation\n As regards inter -temporal variation, the analysis presented in the chapter revealed that the growth rate in capital intensity in the Indian economy was much higher during 2003-2017 (over 6.5 per cent per year) than that during 1980 -1993 and 1994-2002. This accelerated growth obviously had adverse implications for job creation . It is particularly important to note that although annual employment growth between 1999 and 2011 was positive at about 1.4 per cent, it declined and became negative between 2011 and 2017 at about ( -)0.2 per cent. As the number of new entrants into the labour force increases in the coming years, appropriate policy action is needed to contain the growth in capital intensity of production, particularly in manufacturing, and thereby help create more jobs. Initial examination of trends in capital intensity, labour productivity and real (product) wage rate followed by a more sophisticated econometric analysis of the impact of wage rental ratio on capital intensity indicated that the explanation for the marked rise in the growth rate in capital intensity in the period 2003 -2017 probably lies largely in an increase in the growth rate in real wages. One possible area of policy action that might help in moderating the rise in capital intensity lies in containment of growth in prices of wage goods (e.g., increases in food prices) which will arguably help in containing the growth in real (product) wages to the extent possible. A second, and more promising, area of policy action lies in promotion of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs). The contribution that such enterprises may make towards job creation is well recognised. However, in a global economic situation marked by recessionary conditions and intense competition in global markets, it is important to ask how the MSME sector in India may be given a major boost, particularly how to help them become capable of competing in global value chains. This obviously calls for appropriate policy for further promotion of MSMEs with support for improving their competitiveness. It needs to be recognized in this context that although there are a number of schemes for the promotion of MSMEs in India (and other supporting policy measures), such enterprises face several serious challenges constraining their performance and growth, the two important ones among them being related to (a) availability of credit and risk capital, and (b) adoption of superior technology and achievement of high product quality standards. Needless to say, adequate access to credit, adoption of superior technology, advancement in product quality, step -up in infrastructure facilities, and other such improvements will enable India\u2019s MSMEs to get much better integrated into global value chains which will in turn contribute to the growth of the sector. These improvements will also help in building stronger linkages between the large industrial Initial examination of trends in capital intensity, labour productivity and real wage rate followed by a more sophisticated econometric analysis of the impact of wage rental ratio on capital intensity indicated that the explanation for the marked rise in the growth rate in capital intensity in the period 2003-17 probably lies largely in an increase in the growth rate in real wages."

    "output": "The MSME sector in India is dominated by micro-enterprises that often remain small, hindering their ability to adopt advanced technology and improve product quality. An enabling business environment is needed to incentivize micro-enterprises to grow and enhance their competitiveness. Sustainable Development Goal 9 emphasizes building resilient infrastructure, promoting inclusive and sustainable industrialization, and fostering innovation. Key components include raising industry's share of employment and GDP and increasing access to financial services and value chains for small-scale enterprises. To raise industry's share in employment and GDP requires policies that help in changing the structure of the India\u2019s economy from a service -driven one to a manufacturing-driven one. The National Manufacturing Policy (NMP) of 2011 and the Make-in-India (MII) programme launched in 2014 reflect the government's emphasis on manufacturing sector growth. Significant advancements have been made to support NMP and MII with regard to the ease of doing business and efforts are underway for making further progress in this regard. However, boosting MSMEs is crucial to raising the share of industry in employment, requiring careful consideration of policies to build capacities for better credit, technology, and market linkages, particularly for integrating into global value chains."

The chapter includes an analysis of trends in energy intensity (Section 10.1) followed by an econometric analysis of the determinants of energy use and energy intensity (Section 10.2). A key aspect of the analysis involves computing energy intensity using a physical measure of energy. Section 10.1 is further divided into subsections that cover trends in energy intensity at the aggregate manufacturing level (both organized and unorganized segments), trends in organized manufacturing (at both aggregate and for the 13 KLEMS manufacturing industries), and the impact of changes in real energy prices on energy demand/consumption in organized manufacturing. The final section (Section 10.5) summarizes the findings, concludes, and draws some policy implications. A study of trends in energy intensity in the Indian economy assumes significance because lowering energy intensity contributes to competitiveness of domestic industries, and energy intensity has important implications for India being able to meet her commitments on the containment of emissions intensity made under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Reduced dependence on energy input in the production activity in energy-intensive industries would relax supply side constraints arising from inadequacies of energy supply that might be adversely impacting their growth process. Manufacturing is the biggest user of energy. In recent years, the share of manufacturing in energy consumption in the Indian economy has been a little more than half (after disregarding energy use by households and non-energy use of natural gas and some petroleum products)."

A decomposition analysis is undertaken to find out how far structural changes have contributed to inter-temporal movements in energy intensity at the aggregate (organised) manufacturing level. This is followed in Section 9.1.3 by a brief discussion on the impact of energy price on energy use and energy intensity in organised manufacturing.

Thus, the movements in the two series have some degree of similarity, and for the period 2011-12 to 2017-18, an upward trend is observed in both. Also, considering the entire period under study, the average annual growth rate in energy intensity in manufacturing during 1981-82 to 2017-18 was about (-)2.1 per cent per annum, and the average annual growth rate in the ratio of value of energy used to gross output during this period was about (-) 1.2 per cent per annum."

    "output": "To further analyse the trends in recent years, growth rates in energy use in manufacturing disaggregated by the types of fuel were considered. Figure 10.3 depicts annual compound growth rates computed between the years 1993-94 and 2005-06, 2005-06 and 2010-11, and 2010-11 and 2017-18.\n\nGrowth rate in real output in manufacturing during 1993-2005 (at 7.3 per cent per annum) was much higher than that in aggregate energy use in manufacturing (2.4 per cent per annum). While coal consumption grew at a rather low rate of about 1.2 per cent per annum during this period, the growth in consumption of petroleum products was relatively faster at about 2.8 per cent per annum. The annual growth rate in real output in the manufacturing sector increased to about 12 per cent during 2005-10, and this was accompanied by a hike in the annual growth rate in aggregate energy use in manufacturing to about 8.9 per cent during 2005-10. The annual growth in coal used by manufacturing increased from about 1.2 per cent during 1993-2005 to about 9.3 per cent during 2005-10. Petroleum product consumption accelerated likewise. Power consumption growth rose sharply from about 4.9 per cent per annum during 1993-2005 to about 11.8 per cent per annum during 2005-10. Yet, aggregate energy use in manufacturing during 2005-11 grew at a slower pace than real gross output, with the consequence that energy intensity in manufacturing fell during this period."

During the same period, the annual growth rate in aggregate energy consumption in manufacturing went up slightly from about 8.9 percent to about 9.0 percent, resulting in an increase in energy intensity in manufacturing. The growth rate in power consumption in manufacturing slowed in the latter period, whereas the growth rate of petroleum products consumption in manufacturing increased substantively. There was a substitution of coal and electricity by petroleum products in manufacturing, with petroleum products consumption growing annually at about 11.1 percent during 2010-17, primarily led by petroleum coke, which grew at about 27 percent per annum. The cement industry is a major consumer of petroleum coke in Indian manufacturing."

    "output": "Between the trienniums ending 2006-07 and 2016-17, energy intensity in aggregate organised manufacturing fell by about 40 per cent. The fall was relatively greater in Non-metallic Mineral Products (54 per cent).  Other industries in which the fall was relatively large are Rubber and Plastic Products (70 per cent), Electrical and Optical Equipment (68 per cent) and Machinery n.e.c. (53 per cent). In contrast, the fall was relatively small in the case of Basic Metals and Fabricated Metal Products (19 per cent). To further understand the sources of change in energy intensity in aggregate organised manufacturing, a decomposition exercise was undertaken. It decomposed the change in energy intensity at the aggregate level into (a) structural change effect, (b) intensity effect and (c) residual. This analysis was done for two periods: (1) between 2004-05 and 2011-12, and (2) between 2011-12 and 2016-17. Between 2004-05 and 2011-12, energy intensity of aggregate organised manufacturing fell by about 35 per cent. This was primarily caused by the intensity effect which was found to be (-)32 per cent and structural changes made a relatively much lower contribution as this effect was estimated to be (-)5.7 per cent.  The residual term is 2.7 per cent. However, the subsequent period from 2011-12 to 2016-17 saw a smaller decline of about 12 per cent in energy intensity in aggregate organised manufacturing. While this period also saw a relatively larger attribution to lowering of energy intensity (estimated at ( -)7.8 per cent) across industries, the decomposition analysis was done using a Laspeyres decomposition technique."

    "output": "The key findings of the econometric analysis presented in Section 10.2 clearly show a significant negative relationship between energy price and energy demand in manufacturing. The estimated price elasticity of demand for energy emerging from the model estimates range from (-)0.8 to (-)1.3, and the coefficient is found to be statistically significant. Thus, the results provide sufficient basis to infer that there exists an inverse relationship between real energy price and energy demand in manufacturing, and the fall in real price in energy that took place between 2011-12 and 2017-18 could indeed be an important factor that halted (or slowed) the downward trend in energy intensity in manufacturing prevailing earlier.\n\nEconometric analysis of determinants of energy use and energy intensity in organized manufacturing has been undertaken using panel data at three-digit industry level (72 industries) for nine years, 2008-09 to 2016-17. Three models have been estimated:\n\nModel 1:  \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61 = \uf061+ \uf066\ud835\udc56 + \uf071\ud835\udc61 + \uf0621\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc44\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61 + \uf0622\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61 + \uf0623\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61 + \ud835\udc62\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61 \u2026 (10.1)\nIn this equation, E denotes energy use (in oil equivalent), Q denotes real gross output, P denotes real price of energy and KI denotes capital intensity. Subscript i is for industry and subscript t is for time (year). The year dummies are denoted by \uf071t. This allows the function to shift over time and capture year-specific effects. The error term is denoted by u. Real output is computed by deflating nominal gross output by an output price index. For each industry each year, the value of energy is divided by quantity of energy to compute (implicit) energy price. This is divided by price (index) of output to obtain real price of energy. Capital intensity is measured by taking the closing book value of fixed capital and dividing it by gross value of output at current prices.\n\nModel 2:  \uf044\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61 = \uf061+ \uf066\ud835\udc56+\uf071\ud835\udc61+\uf0621\uf044\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc44\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61 + \uf0622\uf044\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61 + \uf0623(\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61 \ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc61\u22121\u2044 ) + \ud835\udc62\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61 \u2026 (10.2)\nIn Model 2, EI denotes energy intensity, i.e., E/Q as defined above. GI denotes gross fixed capital formation during the year t. This is divided by the closing book value of fixed assets in the previous year. The term may be interpreted as the growth rate in fixed capital stock. The aim is to find out the effect of new investment on energy intensity. The equation may be seen as basically a transformation of Model-1 in difference form, except that energy intensity is taken as the dependent variable instead of the level of energy use and change in capital intensity is replaced by growth in capital stock.\n\nModel 3: \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61 = \uf061+ \uf066\ud835\udc56 + \uf071\ud835\udc61 + \uf0621\uf044\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc44\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61 + \uf0622\uf044\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61 + \uf0623(\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61 \ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc61\u22121\u2044 ) + \uf067 \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc61\u22121 + \ud835\udc62\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61 (10.3)"

    "output": "The model estimates clearly indicate a negative effect of energy price on energy demand and energy intensity. The coefficient has a plausible numerical value and is statistically significant at one percent in the estimates of all three models (as shown in Tables 10.2, 10.3 and 10.4). The coefficient of real output is positive and statistically significant in the estimates of Model -1 (Table 10.2), with a numerical value less than one. The coefficient is found to be negative in numerical value and statistically significant in the estimates of Models 2 and 3. This suggests a less-than proportional relationship between real output and energy consumption at the industry level, where energy consumption increases less than proportionately with growth in output, leading to a fall in energy intensity. The estimates of Model -1 presented in Table 10.2 indicate a positive relationship between capital intensity and energy intensity, perhaps suggesting a complementary relationship between capital input and energy input in the short run. The regression results presented in Tables 10.3 and 10.4 indicate that a high rate of new investment tends to raise energy intensity. These results suggest that a high rate of investment tends to raise energy use more than output, and hence raises energy intensity."

    "output": "The main finding emerging from the results of this econometric analysis presented above is that energy pricing has a significant effect on its demand and on energy intensity in organised manufacturing. Two other interesting findings emerging from the regression analysis are: (1) there is a less than proportionate effect of output growth on energy demand, and (2) a high rate of investment tends to raise energy use more than output and hence raises energy intensity. The implication of a less than proportionate effect of output growth on energy demand is that in a period of rapid growth in manufacturing sector output, there is a downward pressure on energy intensity. By that logic, as the growth rate of manufacturing sector output slows down, the downward pressure on energy intensity causing energy intensity to fall is no longer present.\n\nThe model explaining energy intensity, regression results (dependent variable: logarithm of energy intensity), alternate treatment of time variable is shown in Table 10.7.

    "output": "The quantile regression method has been used for the econometric analysis. The dependent variable is the logarithm of energy intensity. The explanatory variables are the logarithm of real gross output, the logarithm of real energy prices, export intensity and imported materials intensity. The year dummies are included in the estimated model. The results are shown in Table 10.8. Estimates of the model have been made for the 50th percentile (the median) of the distribution of energy intensity, and for the 25th percentile and the 75th percentile.\n\nThe results show a negative effect of energy price on energy intensity, which matches the results in Tables 10.2 to 10.7. The negative coefficient of the real output variable in the results reported in Table 10.8 is consistent with the results in tables 10.2 and 10.5. The results indicate that imports of materials reduce energy intensity. The coefficient is found to be negative and statistically significant. This is consistent with the findings of Imbruno and Ketterer (2018) in their study of the Indonesian firms. As regards exporting, a significant negative effect of export intensity on energy intensity is found for the 75th percentile of the energy intensity distribution, but not for the 50th and 25th percentile. It may thus be inferred that exporting tends to reduce energy intensity in high energy-intensive industries but not in low energy intensive industries. A similar finding for Indian manufacturing has been reported by Mart\u00ednez-Zarzoso et al. (2020) who find that exporting has a negative effect on energy intensity among firms in the high energy-intensive industries but not among firms in the low energy-intensive industries. Similarly, Sahu et al. (2021), who have applied the quantile regression method to firm-level data, find that exporting has a negative effect on energy intensity among high energy-intensive firms but not among low energy-intensive firms. Clearly, the results reported in Table 10.8 is in line with the findings of Sahu et al. (2021)."

A fall in the real price of energy input in manufacturing between 2011-12 and 2017-18 could be a factor in halting or slowing the previously prevailing downward trend in energy intensity.

Conversion factors for computing oil equivalent are taken from diverse sources, including the Indian Petroleum and Natural Gas Statistics; for example, 1 KWH of electricity is equivalent to 0.00085 tonnes of oil, and 1 Sm3 of natural gas is equivalent to 0.00084 tonnes of oil."

    "output": "Computation of energy use in manufacturing takes into account the sector\u2019s consumption of coal, power, natural gas, and various petroleum products including diesel oil, furnace oil, Low Sulphur Heavy Stock (LSHS), petroleum coke, and lubricants. Computation of total energy use for the purpose of constructing the energy intensity series is based on the concept of final use, i.e., the concept of \u2018final consumption of energy commodity\u2019 is used rather than \u2018total primary energy supply\u2019. Out of the total consumption of each specific petroleum products in the manufacturing sector, the part that is consumed by industry as feedstock (e.g., the consumption of naphtha in fertiliser and petrochemicals), rather than as fuel, is excluded. In other words, non-energy use of petroleum products and natural gas is excluded. Auxiliary consumption in captive power plants in the manufacturing sector has been taken into account and treated as energy consumption in manufacturing.\nSome adjustments have been made to the data on coal consumption provided in Energy Statistics published by the NSO (National Statistical Office). The coal consumption figures for the years 2004-05 to 2010-11 have been adjusted upward to take into account imports of coal. The sector wise distribution of total coal consumption for years 2009-10 onwards, particularly from 2014-15, has been modified by considering the sector-wise distribution of imported coal. For this purpose, the coal consumption data in power utilities as given by the Central Electricity Authority have been considered along with such data taken from the publications of the Coal Controller\u2019s Organisation. For electricity, consumption data are available for the industry sector (which includes mining and quarrying) and not separately for manufacturing. Electricity consumption in mining and quarrying is relatively small compared with manufacturing, and therefore, no adjustment has been made to remove it. Electricity consumption data for industry has been treated as that for manufacturing.\nTo derive coal consumption in manufacturing, coal consumption in power plants (utilities and non-utilities), households and the transport sector has been subtracted from aggregate coal consumption, and then in the next step, coal consumption in hotels and restaurants has been subtracted. The series thus obtained is treated as coal consumption in manufacturing. Domestic (i.e., household) consumption of coal for the years 1980-81 to 1983-84 has been taken from the official data. This has been extrapolated till 2016-17 using data on rural and urban population and percentage of rural and urban households using coal/coke as fuel for cooking taken from National Sample Survey Reports for different years (1983, 1993-94, 1999-2000, 2004-05, 2009-10, 2011-12). Consumption of coal in hotels and restaurants has been estimated with the help of data on expenditure on coal in different industries provided in input-output tables and supply-use tables.\nIn the last 10 years, there has been a huge increase in the consumption of petroleum coke in the country, and at present among the petroleum products consumed in manufacturing, it greatly dominates over diesel, furnace oil and LSHS. Petroleum coke is used mostly in industries but is used also in power generation. Data are not available on sector-wise breakup of petroleum coke consumption (according to some media reports, the cement industry takes up about three-fourth of petroleum coke consumption in India), and no information could be gathered on what portion of petroleum coke supply is used as fuel in power plants. Therefore, the entire consumption of petroleum coke in the country has been treated as energy consumption by manufacturing. The conversion factors used are 0.44 for domestically produced coal and 0.6 for imported coal (also for exported coal). For lignite, the conversion factor used is 0.23. For electricity, the conversion factor used is 1KWH = 0.00085 tonnes of oil equivalent. For natural gas, the conversion factor used is 1 Sm 3 of natural gas = 0.00084 tonnes of oil equivalent. For various petroleum products, the conversion factors differ; for example, it is 1.130 for LPG, 1.075 for ATF, 1.035 for diesel oil, and 0.985 for residual fuel oil."

    "output": "Industry-level energy intensity estimates have been made for the organised or registered segment of manufacturing. The basic source of data is the Annual Survey of Industries (ASI) (Central Statistics Office, Government of India). The estimates have been made for the years 2004-05 to 2016-17. Estimates of energy use have first been made at three-digit industry level (NIC-2008), which have then been aggregated to obtain the estimates for the 13 manufacturing industries according to India KLEMS industry classification.\nIn the published results of ASI, energy consumption data are provided for coal, electricity, and petroleum products, and other items are clubbed under the head \u2018other fuel\u2019. For coal and electricity, both quantity and value are provided. For this study, the value figures reported in ASI published results have been taken for each 3-digit industry for each year, and the quantities of coal and electricity used in the 3-digit industry have been derived by first computing median rate (i.e. price at which coal or electricity is purchased) among the factories belonging to the 3-digit industry using unit-level data (i.e. factory level data) and then dividing the value figure by the median rate. The quantities of coal and electricity so obtained have been multiplied by the conversion factors to derive oil equivalent.\nThe figure on expenditure on petroleum products has been divided by the price of furnace oil to compute equivalent quantity of furnace oil which has then been multiplied by the conversion factor to derive the oil equivalent.\nThe figure on expenditure on \u2018other fuels\u2019 reported in ASI has been divided into two parts: expenditure on natural gas and expenditure on other fuels. The relative share of natural gas has been computed (for each three-digit industry) from unit-level ASI data, and this has been used for splitting of the expenditure on \u2018other fuels\u2019 reported in ASI. The expenditure on natural gas has been divided by natural gas price (median rate computed at two-digit industry level using unit-level data of ASI and applied to all constituent three-digit industries) to derive quantity and then, by applying conversion factor, the oil equivalent has been obtained.\nAfter removing the expenditure on natural gas from the reported expenditure on \u2018other fuels\u2019 in ASI, the balance has been treated primarily as expenditure on fuel wood. Using price of fuel wood, the quantity figure has been derived and then, by applying the conversion factor, the oil equivalent has been derived.\nAfter deriving the quantities (in oil equivalent) of coal, electricity, petroleum products, natural gas and other fuels (treated predominantly as fuel wood) in each 3-digit industry each year according to the method explained above, these have been added to obtain the total quantity of energy use. The quantity of energy is divided by deflated gross value of output (at 2011-12 prices) to compute energy intensity. The 3-digit industries have been mapped into the 13."

    "output": "Industry-level energy intensity estimates have been made for the organised or registered segment of manufacturing using data from the Annual Survey of Industries (ASI) for the years 2004-05 to 2016-17. For 2008-09 to 2016-17, estimates were made at the three-digit industry level (NIC-2008), aggregated to 13 manufacturing industries according to India KLEMS classification.  In published ASI results, energy consumption data are provided for coal, electricity, and petroleum products, with other items under \u2018other fuel\u2019. Value figures were used for coal and electricity, and quantities were derived by dividing the value by the median rate (price) among factories.  Petroleum product expenditure was divided by the price of furnace oil to compute equivalent quantity, which was then converted to oil equivalent. The \u2018other fuels\u2019 expenditure was split into natural gas and other fuels using relative shares from unit-level ASI data.  The natural gas expenditure was divided by the natural gas price to derive quantity and oil equivalent. The remaining expenditure was treated as fuel wood, and its quantity was derived using the price of fuel wood. Quantities (in oil equivalent) of coal, electricity, petroleum products, natural gas, and other fuels were summed to obtain total energy use, which was then divided by deflated gross value of output (at 2011-12 prices) to compute energy intensity. For three industries\u2014Manufacture of Non-Metallic Mineral Products (NIC 239), Manufacture of Basic Iron and Steel (NIC 241), and Manufacture of Basic Precious and Other Non-Ferrous Metals (NIC 242)\u2014imports of coal and coke were accounted for, adjusting the energy use estimates. For 2004-05 to 2007-08, published ASI data on energy use by 4-digit NIC were used directly, with adjustments made to include imports of coal and coke for Manufacture of Other Non-Metallic Mineral Products (NIC-2004, industry code 26) and Manufacture of Basic Metals (NIC-2004, industry code 27). Relative shares of fuelwood and natural gas within the \u2018others\u2019 category were derived from the 2008-09 and 2009-10 data for different KLEMS manufacturing industries and applied to data from 2004-05 to 2007-08.  The price of fuelwood for 2004-05 to 2007-08 was derived from unit-level data of ASI. The value of natural gas used was divided by an average rate extrapolated backward from 2008-09 using the consumer price of natural gas."

In this equation, t is the subscript for time (year), E denotes energy in oil equivalent, XI denotes export intensity (i.e., exports to output ratio; data on exports taken from Handbook of Statistics on Indian Economy, Reserve Bank of India), Q denotes gross output at constant prices (taken from India KLEMS database, 2019), M denotes materials input at constant prices (thus, M/Q is the ratio of materials to output), and Q ei/Qtotal denotes the share of top four energy intensive industries in the total real output of all 13 manufacturing industries. The error term is denoted by ut. The model is estimated using data for the periods 1980 to 2017 and 1980-2010, and the estimated long run coefficients are shown in Table 10C.1 and a comparison of actual energy intensity with the predicted energy intensity for the years 2000-2017 is presented in Fig. 10C.1.

    "output": "The nature of relationship that exists between trade and energy intensity of domestic industry has been investigated in the literature using economy or sector level data, and some studies have found a positive effect of trade on energy intensity. There are quite a few studies that have found a negative effect of exports on energy intensity. The results obtained from the econometric exercise undertaken for this study show that, in the case of India, exports had a negative effect on energy intensity of Indian manufacturing, i.e., a higher level of exports of manufactured products by Indian manufacturing industry would lead to improvement in energy use efficiency.\n\nThe model estimated for the period 1980-2010 predicts the actual energy intensity for this period quite well. However, for predictions going beyond the sample period, it is found that the actual energy intensity is higher than that predicted by the model (Fig. 10C.1), suggesting that after 2010, there were certain forces at work other than the variables considered in the model which caused a halt to the downward trend in energy intensity of the manufacturing sector prevailing earlier, and led to a trend reversal. This is consistent with the analysis presented in Section 10.2 of the chapter."

Telecommunication services were solely provided by the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) until licensed private players entered in 1992. The banking sector was nationalized in 1969, leading to public sector dominance. Transport services had public monopolies, and the insurance sector was mainly operated by four public sector entities. Gross output and value added of the service sector remained stagnant in the pre-reforms period. However, there was a clear upward trend starting from the early 1990s, which was a period of liberalization for the sector. The economic reforms of the 1990s, which paved the way for trade liberalization, along with major policy changes in the domestic business environment helped the emergence of the service sector as a key player in India\u2019s growth story."

    "output": "The service sector encompasses a plethora of diverse and heterogeneous economic activities. In India\u2019s National Accounts Statistics, the sector consists of: wholesale and retail trade, hotels and restaurants, transport services, storage services, communication services, financial services, real estate, ownership of dwellings and renting services, business services and other social, community and personal services. In terms of measurement, it is probably more difficult to measure than goods, as services often represent a process by which a consumer is charged \u2014hence there are conceptual problems in both \u201cquantity\u201d and \u201cquality\u201d of services (Melvin, 1995), as well as determining the price of the service. For collection of data and analysis, the subsectors are further categori sed into public, private organised, and private unorganised. The public sector estimates of gross value added are obtained from data on output and intermediate outputs from budget documents. For some sectors of the private organi sed segment and most of the private unorgani sed segment, value added is computed using the \u2018labour input\u2019 method\u2014multiplying the estimates of value added per worker in a benchmark year with the estimated labour force from census surveys (Nayyar, 2012). However, each of the methods of measurement has its own problems. Given that the output of service sector is often measured in terms of employee compensation, an increase in wages would imply an increase in real output even with the same actual activities. On the other hand, the quality of the crucial components of the \u2018labo ur input\u2019 method \u2014estimates of the workforce and estimates of value added per worker\u2014are quite low (Tendulkar, 2007). Lastly, the lack of a suitable service sector price index depletes the precision of constant price estimates of this sector."

There may be various reasons for the low employment absorption in the overall services sector relative to its share in GVA. Nayyar (2012) finds that educational requirements vary across different subsectors in the service sector and manifests itself through low quality of employment. Business services show the maximum growth (around 12 per cent per annum), for the 1981-2017 period. If we consider the period of 2003-07, we find post and telecommunications and business services exhibiting high growth rates of around 11 per cent and 13 per cent, respectively. The telecommunication liberalisation began in 1994 with the private sector being allowed to offer telecom services. The rapid innovation in IT makes it a dynamic contributor to the growth of the Indian economy by itself (Singh, 2014)."

Singh (2006A) argues that services had proportionately the largest inducing effect in terms of backward linkages as well as forward linkages (albeit weaker than backward linkages). These linkages, the author argues, had an important impact in the reduction of transaction cos ts during the 1980s and 1990s and subsequently stimulated the entire economy to an extent. Moreover, introduction of a range of rural ICT services (ICTS) provides spillovers from ICTS through knowledge acquisition and information access (Singh (2006B)). Se veral policy implications emerge from the analysis \u2014tackling education and technological bottlenecks and some labo ur market reforms that improve the innovation capabilities in the economy can go a long way to solve the problems of the service sector to increase its scope and labo ur absorption abilities , while continuing to remain dynamic for leading India\u2019s economic growth. We need to infer if the driving force behind the service sector growth in India can be explained through improvements in resource use efficiency (both labour and total factor productivity growth).

    "input": "Question: What are the inputs considered in the chapter, and how is labor productivity growth in India's service sector summarized?",
    "output": "In the present chapter, three intermediate inputs\u2014energy, material, and services\u2014have been considered. This is important as we may find that intermediate inputs are the primary component of some industries\u2019 outputs. Failure to quantify intermediate inputs leads us to miss both the role of key industries that produce intermediate inputs and the importance of intermediate inputs for the subsectors that use them. Our measure of labor input incorporates qualitative aspects of the labor force in terms of education while defining a new, refined measure of labor input as the product of labor person and quality index. The capital input defined in terms of capital service takes the asset heterogeneity into account as against a measure of capital stock which is devoid of it. Labour productivity in India\u2019s service sector has been growing substantially over the decades of the study period, and much of this productivity gain is accruing through acceleration in non-market services productivity. In the pre-reforms phase (1981-93), non-market services showed higher labor productivity growth relative to market services, with the opposite happening in the reform phase (1994-02) and the golden growth phase (2003-07). However, market services fell behind non-market services in terms of labor productivity growth in the global slowdown phase (2008-17). A closer examination further suggests that ICT intensive sectors, in particular trade and post & telecommunication have driven much of the market services productivity growth, while non-market services growth has been led by public administration. For the entire study period, labor productivity in services grew at the rate of close to 4 percent per annum. Turning attention to the individual industries within services, we find that a majority shows labor productivity growth lower than the sectoral average, the exceptions being post and telecommunication, public administration, and health and social work which register high labor productivity growth in the region of 5 to 6 per cent."

All the service industries mentioned above had significant changes in their business environment beginning from the 1990s covering regulation as well as policy measures. For road transport, we find reforms from early 1990s covering entry of private players, amendments in motor vehicle laws, setting up of National Highways Act. Domestic air transport was liberalised in 1993 with the monopoly of Indian Airlines\u2019 being abolished, leading to greater competitive pressure in domestic air services. In the case of telecom services, most manufacturing services were completely under governmental domain and private firms were allowed to provide telecommunication services in 1992 with the introduction of cellular service licences. In 1994, the government announced a new National Telecom Policy that provided guidelines for the private sector\u2019s involvement. In financial services, especially banking, substantial reforms were undertaken pertaining to new banks and licensing policies. In 1993, the government issued guidelines for allowing entry of new private banks, although approvals remained difficult due to stringent RBI regulations. Reforms in the insurance sector commenced in the latter part of 1990s and securities markets were also streamlined. \n\nTable 11.3 also includes the following data: Labour productivity growth in service industries by subperiod: 1981\u20132017 (% per annum).

    "output": "Table 11. 4 shows the industry contributions to aggregate labour productivity growth by subperiod from 1981-2017. Labour productivity in the Indian service sector has been growing substantially over decades, and much of this gain has accrued through acceleration in the contribution of market services labour productivity to aggregate service labour productivity growth. While the nonmarket services productivity contribution declined from about 2 per cent in the pre-reform period (1981-93) to around 1.3 per cent in the two post-reforms decades, market services witnessed an increase in its contribution from less than 1 per cent (1981-93) to above 3 per cent (2003-2007). Market services retained its lead over non-market services even in the global slowdown phase (2008-17), albeit with a very small margin. Within ICT intensive services\u2014business services, trade, and financial services led much of the service sector productivity growth. Within ICT non-intensive services, the transport and storage sector contributed a major part of aggregate productivity improvement. Almost all nonmarket services, except public administration and education, showed a deceleration in their contribution to aggregate service sector productivity in the reform phase (1994-02). However, these services would go on to improve their contribution in the 2000s. Aggregate service labour productivity improved in the 1990s (4.41 per cent) compared to that of 1980s (2.89 per cent). However, the contribution of market services to aggregate service sector productivity growth increased both in 1990s and 2000s, with the ICT intensive services maintaining their lead over non-ICT intensive services. Notably, in the global slowdown phase (2008-17), the contribution of ICT intensive services to aggregate labour productivity increased, while that of ICT non-intensive services fell behind. This increase in the contribution of the market services, and in particular ICT intensive services, to aggregate service sector productivity might indicate the increasing role of ICT in contributing to labour productivity growth. The labour reallocation effect is positive in all sub periods and for the full study period. The labour reallocation effect increased in the 1990s and 2000s following the reforms of early 1990s, suggesting a growth-enhancing structural transformation, with resources apparently moving from less productive to more productive services. However, this reallocation effect took a step back in the global slowdown phase of 2008-17."

    "output": "The standard growth accounting exercise attributes the main source of increases in labor productivity per person employed to TFP growth and capital deepening. TFP growth accounts for much of the improvement in labor productivity in financial services, public administration, and overwhelmingly for transport and storage. For the rest of the services, except for education (where the contribution of TFP growth and capital deepening is very close), the contribution of TFP growth is mostly small. For non-market services, there is very low or negligible contribution from overall productivity growth in accounting for labor productivity growth. Also, there is a negligible role of labor quality in explaining labor productivity in services, while capital deepening remains large for many sectors, including health and education. The main contributor to labor productivity growth across different service sectors is found in total factor productivity, not in differences in the intensity of the production factors especially labor and capital. The estimates of TFP growth in this section for various subsectors of services are calculated using gross output as the measure of output, and primary inputs of capital (K) and labour (L), along with the input trio of energy (E), materials (M) and services (S) together constituting intermediate inputs in what has come to be known as the KLEMS framework for measuring productivity (the period under consideration is 1980-2017)."

    "output": "The TFP growth for broad categories of services is depicted in Figure 11.5. In the pre-reform phase of 1981-93, TFP growth of non-market services outperformed that of market services. However, an improvement in the TFP growth of market services is observed in the reform phase of 1994-02. Market services maintained this lead over non-market services in the golden growth phase of 2003-07 as well. However, TFP growth rate of market services fell considerably behind non-market services in the global slowdown phase of 2008-17. The low TFP growth of market services in relation to non-market services during the pre-reform phase and the global slowdown phase leads to the overall picture with higher TFP growth of non-market services over market services for the entire period of 1981-2017. Within market services, a peculiar trend is observed: TFP growth of ICT intensive services consistently fell behind ICT non-intensive services, after having outperformed the latter in the pre-reform phase. For the entire period of 1981-2017, the subgroups with the highest TFP growth are public administration, transport and storage, and business services neck-and-neck with financial services. Public administration consistently registered high TFP growth rates for each sub-period before coming out on top in the global slowdown phase of 2008-17. In the case of transport and storage, the sector started off with a very low base TFP growth in 1981-93 before seeing improvements in its TFP growth in the post economic reform era, slowing down afterwards in the global slowdown phase of 2008-17. Both financial and business services registered decent TFP growth in the pre-reform phase, however in the mid-1990s, the sectors exploited the new methodological framework to address substantive issues for the American economy and EU economy, respectively."

    "output": "From 1981 to 2017, financial and business services experienced a significant decline in TFP growth during 1994-2002, coinciding with the Asian financial crisis and a global economic slowdown. The post and telecommunications sub-sector initially had negative TFP growth (-0.86 percent per annum) in the pre-reform phase but improved significantly in the 1994-02 and 2003-07 periods, only to decline again to -2.23 percent per annum during the global slowdown of 2008-17. In the pre -reform phase of 1981 -93, TFP growth of non -market services outperformed that of market services. However, an improvement in the TFP growth of market services was observed in the reform phase of 1994-02, and market services maintained this lead over non-market services in the golden growth phase of 2003-07 as well. The TFP growth rate of market services fell considerably behind non -market services in the global slowdown phase of 2008 -17. For the entire period of 1981-2017, the subgroups with the highest TFP growth are public administration, transport and storage, and business services neck -and-neck with financial services. Public administration consistently registered high TFP growth rates for each sub-period before coming out on top in the global slowdown phase of 2008-17. The performance of other subgroups, especially non-ICT and non-market services, generally reflected the broader economic trends depicted in Figure 11.6."

    "output": "Table 11.5 presents the decomposition of output growth for the different sub-sectors of services for the period of 1981-2017. The contribution of an input is defined as the product of value share of the input and the growth rate of the input. Thus, each input contributes to output in proportion to its value share, while TFP contributes to output growth point for point. The first column reflects the rate of output growth, and the other columns reflect the contributions of the factor inputs \u2014 labour, capital, material, energy and services and the final column provides the rate of TFP growth.\n\nWe observe wide variations in output growth across different service industries, from over 12 per cent p.a. growth in public administration (the highest) to 5 per cent p.a. growth for \u2018other services\u2019 (the lowest) for the period of 1981-2017. TFP growth comes out as the dominant source of output growth for public administration. When we compare the contribution of factor inputs, we find that capital services make the largest contribution to the output growth across different industries\u2014trade, financial services, health, and business services and the rest of the services that make up for \u2018other services\u2019. Services input is observed to be the dominant source of output."

In the case of telecommunications, major deregulation since 1992 along with the onset of major liberalization in manufacturing and trade sectors, as well as telecom policy reforms recognizing the need for more participants than the incumbent operator, have brought competition and made the industry efficient in terms of TFP dynamics. Furthermore, capital services account for a substantial contribution to improvements in labor productivity during the period 1981-2017 in certain sectors, namely health, education, financial services, trade including wholesale and retails, and hotels and restaurants."

    "output": "The share of ICT intensive sectors (trade, post and telecommunication, financial services) within market services stands at almost 40 percent of total services (2009-10). This may be due to several reasons, including import of capital goods following liberalization of trade policy, especially lowering of tariffs and easing of nontariff barriers in the capital goods sector. It may also reflect the onset of many new technologies (ICT) that enhances capital deepening through liberalization of trade in services. Table 10.6 captures changes in trade policy\u2014nominal tariffs as well as resultant import competition brought about by such changes. Das (2015) finds that for all categories of capital goods, there has been substantial downward shifts in nominal tariff rates as captured by nominal rate of protection. We find across-the-board decline in tariff rates from around 50 percent to almost below 20 percent during the decades of 1990s and 2000s. We find that for office and other computing machineries there is a substantial decline of more than 50 percentage points."

    "output": "The observed growth pattern in the service sector has not been uniform across all services in India. The performance of market-based ICT intensive sectors is impressive, especially telecommunications and financial services. However, by and large, there is a dominance of capital deepening in accounting for growth. It is important to ascertain if information and communication technology (ICT) remained an important source of both capital deepening and total factor productivity growth within services in India. Import liberalization has been a principal component of the economic reforms undertaken in India, and complementary policies such as technology import policy have, to a large extent, contributed to the import and adaptation of ICT equipment and technology in the observed capital deepening within services. Additionally, TFP growth accounted for about a fourth of the real GVA growth achieved by the services sector. Besides productivity growth, labor and capital input growth also contributed to services sector growth while capital input growth emerged as relatively more important."

    "output": "Since the initiation of pro-market reforms in India in 1991 and the revival of Chinese reforms and opening-up programme after Deng Xiaoping's southern China tour in 1992 following the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, the global presence and impact of these two giant economies have increased. The Soviet-type planned economy approach at the centre of early-stage economic policymaking in both India and China accorded a significant role to the government and largely undermined the role of the market and private sector in driving economic growth. However, the degree of freedom for the private sector to operate differed substantially between the two economies, with China being extremely restrictive. India started a partial liberalisation initiative in the mid-1980s, often considered as pro-business reforms that supported the already-established industrial and commercial establishments, yet with a limited role of market forces. Amid a significant balance of payment crisis in the early 1990s, India introduced more stringent market reforms abolishing its licensing system and opening the economy to foreign investment. China, too, started full-fledged pro-market reforms in the 1990s. However, with its authoritative regime, China implemented a massive manufacturing programme and invested heavily in manufacturing infrastructure, which created an export-oriented manufacturing-driven growth path for the country. Although India also devised several policies to develop its manufacturing sector, the country\u2019s growth success was primarily in the services sector. With its significant pool of skilled and educated labour force, it has seen faster growth in several market services, notably computer and software-related services. China's joining of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) at the end of 2001 further helped expand its manufacturing, and resulted in its economy growing at an unmatched speed. Thus, both countries had a distinct path of economic growth, as the sectoral pattern in driving aggregate growth differed substantially. Yet, the two economies have performed far better than the rest of the emerging world. According to the Conference Board's Total Economy Database, the Indian economy grew at an annual average rate of 6.9 per cent during 1992-2018 and China's official growth rate was 10 per cent for the same period. The official GDP estimates of China, however, is highly contested. Alternative estimates of Chinese GDP by the Conference Board following Maddison and Wu (2008) suggest an annual average growth of 7.3 per cent during this period. Obviously, India and China's fast GDP growth also helped improve their standards of living. Their per capita incomes increased at an average annual rate of 6.6 per cent (China) and 5.2 per cent (India)."

    "output": "Between 1992 and 2018, both India and China saw increases in their per capita incomes, reducing the income gap with global frontiers. In 2018, the average Indian's income, evaluated in purchasing power parity terms, was approximately 11% of the average American's income, up from 4.5% in 1992. China's relative per capita income nearly doubled that of India, increasing from 6.4% of the US level in 1992 to 20.5% in 2018.\n\nPrevious literature has investigated the sources of growth in India and China, both in country-specific studies and in a comparative perspective, generally suggesting a positive role of market-oriented reforms in triggering productivity growth, which played a significant role in China and India's growth stories. Past studies comparing the two economies mostly used aggregate or broad sector data to examine sources of growth \u2014considering the importance of proximate sources, factor accumulation, and total factor productivity (TFP)\u2014in both countries, which undermines the importance of sectoral reallocation of resources and the differences in factor price across sectors. For instance, using microdata on manufacturing firms, Hsieh and Klenow (2009) suggest substantial misallocation of labour and capital across sectors which has distorting effects on aggregate manufacturing productivity. Given that the two economies followed substantially different growth paths, the growth stories derived using aggregate data may conceal several industry dynamics. This is particularly important for productivity comparisons, as technological developments typically happen at the industry level. This chapter considers the inter-industry differences in productivity for examining the growth dynamics in India and China. Such industry level analysis of sources of growth requires a significant amount of detailed data in a comparable setting for both countries in a consistent national accounts framework. The KLEMS initiative facilitates the availability of such data, and the China KLEMS data is utilized along with the India KLEMS data in this chapter."

    "output": "Before delving into the analysis of detailed industry-level data, a look into the general trend in India and China's aggregate economy labor productivity levels from a comparative perspective is warranted. Figure 12.1 shows the relative levels of labor productivity in the two economies compared to a few select emerging market economies. The labor productivity levels in this chart are expressed as a percentage of the level in United States. A few points warrant attention. First, both India and China are still far below the US productivity levels \u2014China at 17.5 per cent of the US level, and India at 13.7 per cent.189  Second, both these countries have substantially improved their relative productivity performance since 1992, i.e., during their post -market reforms era \u2014they were at 5 per cent of the US level in 1992. Third, the productivity levels in the two economies are still the lowest compared with other emerging market peers, such as Russia, South Africa, Brazil (the BRICS), and some Asian economies such as Malaysia and Indonesia. Fourth, a noticeable difference compared with other BRICS countries is that while Russia, Brazil, and South Africa have seen an erosion in their productivity levels, India and China have continued to climb up the productivity ladder. All this indicates the relatively faster pace of productivity expansion in China and India compared with other emerging market economies, and potential for further improvement. The two economies started from a very low base in labour productivity in the pre-reform years, with India growing at a mere 2 per cent and China at close to 4 per cent in the 1980-92 period (Figure 12.2) and their labour productivity levels being at about 5 per cent of the US levels in 1992 (Figure 1 2.1).190 China experienced rapid growth in productivity in the 1990s, far more than India. During the 1994-2002 period, China's aggregate labour productivity growth was as high as 6 per cent compared with only 3 per cent in India. China subsequently maintained its 6 per cent aggregate productivity growth during the 2000s, while India, despite growing a bit, remained below 5 per cent\u2014lower than China \u2014 China's faster growth created a gap between India and China in terms of productivity levels, as Figure 1 2.2 shows that between 1980 and 2017, China's productivity index grew seven times, but less than four times in India."

For China, a comparable dataset for 37 industries is obtained from China Industry Productivity Database (Wu, 2020)."

    "output": "Both the Indian and the Chinese data follow the KLEMS principles in measuring primary inputs and output accounts, and therefore their methodologies are quite comparable. Construction of each variable at the industry level is in principle ensured to maintain coherence in the national aggregates, although it is always challenging to deal with missing data and data quality problems. It is impossible to assess how the remaining data problems may have affected our estimates, however, it is reasonable to argue that these problems are limited. One important point to be noted, however, is that all volume indicators in the Chinese data are measured in 2000 prices, but in 2011-12 prices for India. Moreover, India's data are measured for the financial year, running from April 1 to March 31, whereas China's data is the calendar year.\n\nThe Indian data includes three capital assets, namely machinery, transport equipment, and structures, whereas the Chinese data set provides only two assets, that is, machinery mixed with transport equipment and structures. This might have implications for the measured TFP growth (TFPG) rates, as the depreciation rates and rental prices of transport equipment would differ from that of machinery. Therefore, it may affect the measured capital service growth rates and, therefore, TFP; this problem is not expected to be substantial. Finally, due to lack of information, especially for India, the number of employed persons is used as a measure of labor input rather than hours worked, implicitly assuming that an average worker's hour intensity is constant over time, across industries, and between the two economies. However, in China's case, the hour intensity rose substantially from the early 1990s through post-WTO heydays of rapid export-oriented growth and then dropped in the wake of the global financial crisis."

    "input": "Question: How is labor productivity growth analyzed and aggregated in India and China, and what periods are examined in the study?",
    "output": "Labor productivity growth in each of the 27 industries in India and 37 industries in China is decomposed into contributions from capital deepening, labor quality, and total factor productivity (TFP), using the standard growth accounting approach. Subsequently, these industry growth rates are aggregated using value-added weights to create useful industry groupings. The trends in labor productivity and TFP growth rates are documented in the three broad sectors of the economy: agriculture, industry (manufacturing, mining, utilities, and construction), and services (market and non-market) sectors. The productivity trends in the two countries are compared for nine industry groups: agriculture, other goods production, consumer and intermediate goods manufacturing, investment goods manufacturing, trade and distribution, other market services, financial services, business services, and non-market services. The dataset covers the period 1980-2017, analyzed across three time periods: 1980-92, 1993-2002, and 2003-17. These periods align with major policy changes in both economies, including early reforms (1980-92), market reforms (1993-2002), and the post-WTO period for China and a period of high growth in India (2003-17), further subdivided into pre- and post-global financial crisis periods (2002-07 and 2008-17)."

    "output": "Figures 12.3 and 12.4 depict the growth trends in labor productivity and total factor productivity at the broad sector level in India and China. The top-left chart in Figure 12.3 is the same as Figure 12.1 but is reproduced here to get a perspective compared with sectoral patterns of growth. The difference in the aggregate labor productivity growth between China and India is primarily a reflection of the differences in agricultural and industrial sectors. In these sectors, China has made a massive stride in productivity growth compared with India. Productivity in China's agricultural sector improved by seven times during the last four decades, but only by four times in India. In the industrial sector, the gap was even bigger, as the Chinese economy improved its productivity by nearly 13 times, compared with just three times higher productivity in India over the same period. Expansion in the service sector, was however, more comparable for both countries. In fact, India did better than China, with four times higher productivity compared to three and half times higher in China. In Figure 12.4, the trends in TFP growth between the two countries suggest a slightly different picture. China performed well in terms of TFP in the aggregate economy, agriculture, and industry, but in the service sector its performance was much worse than India\u2019s. The early upward trend in China's TFP came to a halt around 1989 \u2014the year in which China faced a severe political crisis. Although the period was characterised by China\u2019s agricultural and industrial reforms, the industrial sector did not see any productivity gain in the pre-1989 years. While TFP in both agricultural and service sectors improved, TFP in the industrial sector declined. Industrial TFP revived during the 1990s reforms, and continued to accelerate until the global financial crisis."

    "input": "Question: How did China's Total Factor Productivity (TFP) change after joining the WTO and during the global financial crisis, and how does it compare to India's TFP growth?",
    "output": "After China joined the WTO in 2001, its manufacturing firms benefited from the international market, improving their productivity growth. TFP in the agricultural sector also improved at an accelerated pace after joining the WTO. However, TFP in the services sector, which accounts for over half of China's GDP, has not improved since the late 1980s. Overall, the aggregate TFP improvement in China in the post-1990 period was driven by the industrial and agricultural sectors, but moderated by the falling TFP in the services sector. During the global financial crisis, aggregate TFP in China retreated, primarily due to a rapid erosion in the services sector's productivity and stagnation in industrial TFP growth. In contrast to China, where TFP growth in the aggregate economy fell since the financial crisis, India's TFP has been rising consistently, albeit at a slower pace. Since China's entry into the WTO, India\u2019s rate of TFP growth has lagged substantially behind. However, India\u2019s continued acceleration in TFP even after the global financial crisis maintained its TFP close to China\u2019s in recent years. The early upward trend in China's TFP came to a halt around 1989. Although the period was characterised by China\u2019s agricultural and industrial reforms, the industrial sector did not see any productivity gain in the pre-1989 years. While TFP in both agricultural and service sectors improved, TFP in the industrial sector declined. Industrial TFP revived during the 1990s reforms, and continued to accelerate until the global financial crisis in the mid-2000s."

    "input": "Question: What were the trends in TFP growth in India's service, industrial, and agricultural sectors, and how did economic reforms affect productivity in both India and China?",
    "output": "In India, TFP growth primarily stemmed from the services sector. While the factor accumulation in India's services sector registered comparable labor productivity growth as in China, it was relatively smaller. India\u2019s industrial sector TFP remained relatively weak, and although TFP growth improved over the years in the Indian agricultural sector, the pace was much slower than in China. In contrast, most of the labor productivity gains in China in the 1990s and 2000s were driven by its vibrant industrial sector, with almost all of its TFP growth in the 1994-2002 period and 70 per cent of TFP growth in the pre-crisis years after 2002 also coming from the same sector. China\u2019s service sector faced a significant productivity set back since the 1990s\u2014except for a moderate uptick in the 2003-07 period, its contribution to aggregate TFP growth was negative, and its TFP deceleration was even more pronounced in the post-crisis period.\n\nUndeniably, economic reforms, opening up to the global economy, and global trade have helped both economies improve their productivity and competitiveness. Although the benefit of reforms did not accrue across the board, rather confined to agricultural and industrial sectors in China and to the service sector in India, the reforms did deliver a positive impact on productivity growth. While there has been a revival in India's service sector productivity in the post -crisis period, China has experienced a major setback in productivity in both the industry and services sector, with the latter facing massive deceleration."

    "instruction": "Answer the question based on the provided context from the financial report.",
    "input": "Question: How does the Total Factor Productivity (TFP) contribute to labor productivity growth in India, and what are the key observations across different sectors?",
    "output": "In India, the contribution of Total Factor Productivity (TFP) to productivity growth in the service sectors ranged from 20 to 50 percent, while it was quite weak in the manufacturing sector\u2014ranging from 1 percent in consumer goods to 15 percent in investment goods manufacturing. One-fourth of the aggregate economy's labor productivity growth was due to TFP, with financial services dominating at more than half, and agriculture and other market services close to a third. Non-market services, including education, health, and government sectors, have a high relative human capital contribution, unlike agriculture and financial services. Improvement in labor quality contributed less than 10 percent of the economy's labor productivity growth, varying across industry groups.  Non-market services performed relatively better in terms of TFP, followed by financial services, both registering a 2 percent annual TFP growth rate. The 'other market services' group, including telecommunications, also had high TFP. The weakest TFP growth was in the 'other goods production' group and in consumer goods manufacturing. The 'other goods production' group, with its negative TFPG, is a likely candidate for poor productivity growth as it includes electricity, gas, and construction. India's construction sector has been performing poorly in productivity, with much of the workforce released from agriculture ending up in the less skill-demanding construction sector, barely adding to its productivity."

    "input": "Question: What were the key factors contributing to labor productivity growth differences between India and China, and how did China's performance compare to India's across different sectors?",
    "output": "When looking at China, the highest labour productivity growth was in the manufacturing sector; investment goods and consumer goods registered labour productivity growth of 11.7 and 7.6 per cent respectively. Agriculture and the two market services industry groups also performed well with productivity growth ranging between 5.5 and 6.5 per cent. Other market economy sectors, financial services, and business services, and even the other goods-producing sectors performed relatively better than their counterparts in India\u2014in the range of 3 to 5 per cent. Non-market services constituted the only industry group with weak performance in productivity growth. In all other sectors, China's labour productivity growth was higher\u20141 to 7per cent more than the respective Indian sector.\n\nAs in India, more than 60 per cent of all labour productivity in the Chinese economy was due to increase in capital deepening. However, the contribution of capital deepening varies substantially\u2014both across China\u2019s sectors and also compared with India. China\u2019s \u2018 other goods production group \u2019 had the highest relative capital deepening contribution \u2014as also observed for India. In both countries, capital contribution grew faster than labour productivity, as their TFP growth was negative for this industry group. Except for trade and non-market services groups, the relative importance of capital deepening (the share of capital deepening in total labour productivity growth compared with TFP and labour quality) was much lower in China than in India. This was despite capital services growing much faster in China across most groups ( except for agriculture and financial services, for which capital expansion was faster in India )\u2014suggesting that China's capital expansion was much more productive than India\u2019s.\nThe contribution of human capital or labour quality to labour productivity growth was generally high in China, except in manufacturing, trade, and business services, which had similar or slower labour quality growth compared with India. Overall, the relative importance of labour quality in driving labour productivity growth was comparable in the two countries at the aggregate level.\nTFP growth was also a profound source of labour productivity difference between India and China. China's manufacturing sectors, agriculture, market services, especially finan cial services, registered high TFP growth rates. In contrast, its \u2018other goods production group\u2019 (as in India) and non-market services (in contrast to India) had negative and weak TFP growth.\nThus, the difference in the speed at which workers are equipped with machines and other types of capital assets is the foremost factor that explains the differences in labour productivity growth between India and China. The second most important factor, nearly as important as capital deepening, is TFP growth. In both cases, China maintains dominance over India, especially in the manufacturing sector.\n\nCapital deepening is the foremost factor that explains the differences in labour productivity growth between India and China. The second factor is TFP growth. In both cases, China maintains dominance over India, especially in the manufacturing sector."

    "output": "In terms of labour productivity growth, China continued to dominate India in all four subperiods from 1981 to 2017. Particularly during 1994-2002, China's T\u00f6rnqvist weighted aggregate labour productivity growth was more than double the growth rate in India. However, India did far better than China in the non-market services in all the subperiods. In contrast, China's non-market services' productivity growth has been consistently negative since the mid-1990s.\n\nTwo other sectors registering better labour productivity performance in India are financial services (1994-2002, and 2008-2017) and business services (1994-2002). The \u2018other market services group\u2019 maintained a somewhat closer growth rate to of its counterpart in China, while in the manufacturing sector, especially in the 1990s and to some extent in the 2000s, China dominated substantially over India. During the pre-crisis years starting 2002, more than 60 per cent of value-added growth resulted from labour productivity improvement in both countries. Moreover, labour productivity growth increased in most industry groups, barring some of India's service sectors (financial services, business services, and other market services) and China's manufacturing sector (both consumer and investment goods) and non-market services."

    "output": "In India, the biggest gain was in manufacturing (both segments) while in China, it was in trade and distribution services and financial services. The agricultural sector also saw impressive productivity gains in both countries. Clearly, there is an interesting shift in productivity performance. While India's manufacturing sector shows an upward tendency, China shows the opposite. However, while productivity performance of India\u2019s service sector declined, it was the opposite in China. Except for non-market services and business services, China's productivity growth was higher than in India by a margin ranging from 1 to 9 per cent across the industry groups. In non-market services, India had significantly high productivity growth while there was a contraction in China, and in business services, the two economies registered comparable labour productivity growth of 3.8 per cent.\n\nIn the post -financial crisis years, India's labour productivity growth was mostly unchanged (declining merely by 0.2 percentage points), while in China, it declined by nearly 2 percentage points\u2014bringing their growth rates even closer, at 4.7 per cent in India and 5.4 per cent in China. However, just two sectors \u2014agriculture and non -market services \u2014registered positive labour productivity in India, and it was primarily non-market services that saved the aggregate economy from a massive slowing of productivity growth. India's productivity growth in the post-crisis years appears to have been driven by the government rather than the private sector. In particular, there was a significant drop in India\u2019s manufacturing productivity, which it had raised in the preceding period. In China, all industry groups fell except business services, the gain of which was not sufficient to offset large declines in financial services, other market services, and trade and distribution sectors. Thus, the interesting feature of this period is the loss of productivity drive in the manufacturing sector in India, which had been observed in the pre-crisis years, and the loss of productivity drive in the services sector that had been seen in China before the crisis.\n\nThe difference in labour productivity growth rates between India and China in industries where China had performed better than India has narrowed to range of 1-5 per cent across the board in the post -crisis period (2008 -2017) compared to a range of 1 -9 percent in the pre -crisis period. Yet most Chinese industry groups still ahead of India. In China, trade & distribution, business services, industry (both consumer & intermediate and investment goods segments of manufacturing and other goods production), and agriculture have recorded higher growth in labour productivity. India performed better in non -market services, where China continued to decelerate. Two other sectors where India scored better in the post -crisis period are other market services and financial services."

    "input": "Question: What patterns of productivity growth do China and India exhibit, and how do these patterns affect their aggregate TFP growth?",
    "output": "Industries in China and India do not follow a uniform yeast pattern of productivity growth. Both countries had an uneven industry pattern of aggregate TFP growth. In other words, they follow a mushroom-type pattern\u2014while some industries grow beyond their relative importance in the economy, others underperform compared to their relative size. In general, the output share of industries that register positive TFPG is higher in China than in India. With higher industry TFP growth and a larger size of the positive TFP sectors, China maintained its productivity edge over India in the 1980s, 1990s, and the pre-crisis period. In the 1980-1993 period, positive contributions from industry TFP growth to aggregate TFP growth added up to 3.3 percentage points in China and 1.2 percentage points in India. The rate of productivity improvement was far higher in China, by a margin of 2 per cent. The remaining industries that had negative TFPG stripped off 1.8 percentage points from China's aggregate TFPG and 0.55 points from that of India, thus dragging down aggregate TFPG in both countries, respectively, to 1.4 per cent in China and 0.6 per cent in India.\nIn the 1990s, China's positive productivity sectors shrank to 65 per cent of the GDP, and their TFP summed to a smaller value of 2.9 per cent, 0.3 points lesser than the previous period. India, on the other hand, increased its positive TFPG marginally to 1.3 per cent, confined to industries that produce less than half the output. During 2002-2007, both countries improved the share of positive TFP industry output to 71 per cent, with an impressive increase in their TFP contribution to 4.3 percentage points in China and a moderate improvement to 1.7 percentage points in India. In the post-crisis period, the output share of industries with positive TFP growth fell in both countries but more intensely in China. More than half of China's production suffered from a negative TFPG, while industries that produce 67 per cent of output in India had positive TFP growth. The overall TFP contribution of the positive TFPG industries fell rapidly in China to a mere 1.8 per cent from 4.3 per cent in the previous period. In contrast, India maintained a 1.7 per cent positive TFP contribution. Thus, despite having a high TFPG in industries with positive TFPG compared to India, the erosion in TFP in other sectors caused China's overall TFP loss in the post-crisis period."

    "input": "Question: What are the roles of capital deepening and labor productivity growth, and how are they comparatively analyzed between India and China?",
    "output": "Since 2008, India's TFP growth pattern has surpassed China's, despite ongoing poor performance in many of its industries. The recent decline in over half of Chinese industries has resulted in China's aggregate TFP performance being poorer than India's. Capital deepening, or the amount of capital (machines, buildings, computers, etc.) workers work with, plays a predominant role in driving labor productivity growth in India and China, and in driving the difference between the two economies. Although capital deepening is an important driver of labor productivity, just investing more in capital may not deliver higher productivity. The productivity effect of capital deepening would rely on the marginal productivity of capital or the elasticity of capital with respect to output. The labour productivity version of the standard Cobb-Douglas production function is used to compare the productivity impact of capital deepening in India with that of China. The table provides the results of a panel regression with the log of the labor productivity indices as the dependent variable and the log of capital per worker indices and log of labor quality indices as independent variables, i.e.: ln \ud835\udc66 = \u03b3 + \u03b21 \u2219 ln \ud835\udc58 + \u03b22 \u2219 ln \ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc44 + \u03b5 (12.3) Capital per worker (k) is estimated using the estimated aggregate capital services growth rates and employment growth rate in each industry, and therefore, an index version of all variables in the regression is used. LQ is the index of labor quality. Note that since both capital per worker and labor productivity are indexed to the base year, the estimated constant ( \u03b3) in equation (3), that is usually the average log level of TFP in Cobb Douglas estimates, and is hard to interpret. Therefore, little significance is attached to the estimated constant in Table 12.4. The aim is to see whether the capital deepening has a differing impact on labour productivity in the two economies. This regression does not account for any control variables, and therefore, should be considered as indicative results only. The regression is estimated using panel data for the aggregate economy \u2014i.e., across 27 sectors in India and 37 sectors in China, over the period 1980-2017\u2014and separately for manufacturing and market services sectors. Both the random effects and fixed effects results are provided in the table. The Hausmann statistics fail to reject the null hypothesis that a random effect model is appropriate in the case of all the three sectors in India. For China, however, a fixed-effect model is preferred for the aggregate economy and manufacturing sector, whereas a random effects model is not rejected for the market services sector. Our discussions are based on the random effects model results for all sectors in India and the market services sector in China. The fixed-effects model is used for the aggregate economy and manufacturing sector in China."

    "output": "Table 12.4 presents regression estimates with the log of labor productivity as the dependent variable. The estimated coefficient of capital deepening is generally higher in China. Specifically, a one percent increase in capital per worker leads to approximately 0.38 percent increase in labor productivity in India and 0.82 percent in China, indicating a higher elasticity of capital in China compared to India. The elasticity is higher than the actual share of capital income in value added in China and lower in India, averaging about 52 percent in both economies during 1980-2017. Key insights include:\n\n1.  The relative impact of capital deepening on labor productivity in China is much higher in manufacturing than in market services.\n2.  The difference between the productivity impact of capital deepening in manufacturing and market services is relatively low in India compared with China; it is higher by 0.15 points in India and 0.6 points in China compared to the market services sector.\n3.

    "output": "In both sectors, India has a better labor quality coefficient, and the gap between the two economies is much larger in market services. Overall, the Chinese economy, especially its manufacturing sector, seems to have seen much success in creating productivity by investing in physical capital compared with India, indicating a higher marginal productivity of capital in Chinese manufacturing. The same trend applies to market services, though the difference between India and China is less intense than in manufacturing. Conversely, upskilling workers has a larger productivity impact in India, primarily in its market services, compared to China. This highlights a capital-driven growth in China's manufacturing and skill-driven growth in India's market services, evident in the marginal productivity effects of these inputs in the two economies. According to Table 12.4, one per cent higher capital per worker leads to about 0.38 per cent labour productivity in India and 0.82 per cent in China, implying that the elasticity of capital in China is far higher than in India."

    "output": "The analysis of the productivity effect of investment in physical capital suggests that the Chinese manufacturing sector was significantly more successful in increasing productivity by investing in physical capital than its Indian counterpart. The marginal productivity of capital has evidently been higher in Chinese manufacturing. India's growth and productivity have been driven by the services sector, with the skill intensity of workers having a higher marginal impact on labor productivity in its market services sector compared to capital deepening. Upskilling workers had a larger productivity impact in India, primarily in its market services, compared to China. The capital-driven nature of growth in China's manufacturing and skill-driven growth in India's market services is visible in terms of the marginal productivity effects of these inputs in the two economies. Furthermore, while the output share of industries with productivity increase was high in China for the entire period, that dominance has eroded substantially since the global financial crisis. The magnitude of decline in more than half of Chinese industries' TFPG has made China's aggregate TFP performance poorer than India's since 2008."

    "output": "This chapter seeks to summarise the report\u2019s main findings and their implications as well as to suggest directions for the India KLEMS database and associated research in the future. The main purpose of the report was to analyse the growth and productivity of the Indian economy with the help of the KLEMS database. It has considered several dimensions of India\u2019s growth and productivity since the 1980s and how these evolved over the period 1980-2017. The phases that marked this period are (i) the partial and major reforms of the 1980s and 1990s, (ii) high growth episodes of the 2000s, and (iii) the global slowdown post 2008. The report\u2019s core chapters provide a comprehensive analysis of the trends in primary inputs \u2013 labor and capital \u2013 and intermediate inputs, along with analysis of economic growth and productivity in India over the last three decades that enables an evaluation of the sources of growth of the Indian economy and related dimensions since the 1980s.\n\nThe main methodology used is the growth accounting approach that allows the decomposition of output growth into growth of inputs and productivity growth. By doing so, it traces the sources of growth in output to increased investment in capital goods, increased use of labor, increased use of intermediate inputs, or increases in efficiency with which inputs are combined to outputs. The analysis was undertaken at a detailed level of industry disaggregation (two-digit industries or thereabout) using the India KLEMS database that provided internationally comparable and harmonised statistics on inputs, outputs, and productivity for 27 sub-industries. The emphasis on the disaggregated approach adopted here allows a detailed understanding of the dynamics at the industry level, which is not possible with the aggregate economy level approach. The novelty of the approach lies in the assessment of contributions of industries to aggregate growth based on an in-depth analysis of data for 27 industries comprising the Indian economy.\n\nThis chapter has seven sections that provide summaries of major findings of all chapters, organized by the main themes addressed. The main findings pertain to the examination of input versus efficiency considerations in the economy\u2019s growth. Second, both labor and total factor productivity of the aggregate economy and the industry origins of the overall growth and productivity performances have been studied. Third, both manufacturing and services have been examined in detail with a focus on growth and productivity. In addition, various aspects of the formal-informal divide were examined for manufacturing industries and of factor intensities in various manufacturing and non-manufacturing industries. The issue of services-led growth was examined for market and non-market service categories and their contribution to the service economy as well as the aggregate economy. The report ends with a discussion comparing growth and productivity of India and China."

    "output": "From 1981 to 2017, the real value added of the aggregate Indian economy grew at a rate of 6 per cent per annum. This growth rate improved over the sub periods until the financial crisis beginning 2007 -08. The value -added growth for the aggregate economy was between 5 to 6 per cent in the period 1981 to 2002, which improved to 7.7 per cent during 2003 -07 and then declined to 6.4 per cent for the sub -period 2008-17. The growth rate of output varied across industries, ranging from 1.16 per cent in wood & wood products to 12.4 per cent in business services. In terms of broad sectors, the services sector grew at a faster annual rate (7.3 per cent) than others, while agriculture grew at a much slower annual rate (3.1 per cent). Within the services sector, market services such as business services, post & telecommunication, and financial services registered faster growth than non-market services including health & social work, education, and public administration. In the case of manufacturing, electrical & optical equipment, rubber & plastic products, coke & petroleum products and transport equipment observed a higher growth rate than other industries. Our analysis reveals that the effect of the financial crisis on value added was much more prominent at the disaggregated industry level. As many as 19 out of 27 industries experienced a decline in growth rate after the financial crisis of 2007-08. Regarding intermediate inputs, their contribution to growth in gross output is high\u2014with the contribution of material inputs to output growth higher than that of other factors of production, as high as 40-50 per cent in the manufacturing sector, while the contribution of service inputs to growth in gross output lies between 10 to 20 per cent. Material input has been the dominant source of output growth for most industries, indicating that intermediate inputs play a crucial role in explaining economic growth at the industry level."

    "output": "Between 1980 and 2017, the Indian economy saw the following trends: The workforce participation rate (WFPR) in India declined from 38.6 per cent in 2011-12 to 34.7 per cent in 2017-18, consistent with the observation of almost no employment growth during 2008-17; rather a fall is found. The decline was evident for both rural and urban sectors, and the WFPR has remained consistently low for the female workforce. The labour income share in India declined from 1980 to 2008, but showed a tendency to increase between 2008 and 2017, mainly due to faster growth in real wages compared with labour productivity growth. The change in the aggregate economy level labour income share seems to be mainly a within-industry effect rather than a structural change effect. The average growth in the labour quality index during the period 1981-2017 has been 1.2 per cent per annum, with a rise in the share of high skilled labour (with education above secondary schools) from 2.4 per cent to almost 13 per cent and a simultaneous decrease in the proportion of employed persons with a level of education below primary level from 70 per cent to 32 per cent."

    "output": "A striking feature of employment trends in India in the recent period is a decline between 2011 and 2017, in aggregate employment and in employment in agriculture and manufacturing. Since the growth rate of real GVA of manufacturing was fairly high at about 7.2 per cent per annum during this period, a decline in employment in manufacturing appears puzzling. It should be pointed out here that there are issues regarding the comparability of various employment surveys, particularly while combining the EUS ( Employment Unemployment Survey) and PLFS (Periodic Labour Force Survey), as was done in this analysis. This may also have implications for the recent fall in employment growth observed between 2011 and 2017 in the data. However, econometric analysis provides some credibility to the stand that it is appropriate to combine EUS with PLFS for construction of labour input series for the recent period, as the model estimates predict a fall in employment during this period in agriculture, industry (excluding construction), and the aggregate economy, which is in line with the actual fall indicated by EUS and PLFS. The recent trends in employment statistics in India indicate a relatively high unemployment rate, especially among the youth, in the last year of our analysis. The youth in rural areas belonging to relatively poorer households are now less inclined and less under compulsion to join labour force than was the situation in the beginning of the 2010s. They would rather stay unemployed than take up a low-paying, low-quality job. Moreover, we also observe a fall in employment trends in the manufacturing sector, indicating the sector's failure in absorbing workers moving out of agriculture."

    "output": "The chapter observes an improving aggregate investment growth over the three sub-periods\u20141981 to 1993, 1994 to 2002, and 2003 to 2017. The fastest investment growth was observed in the 2000s, a period when the Indian economy was growing rapidly. Two broad sectors \u2014 construction and market services\u2014were the main drivers of the high investment growth in the 2000s, although all other broad sectors of the economy, including manufacturing, also grew rapidly during this period. Considering the pace of investment growth across the three asset types, it was observed that the rapid increase in equipment investment facilitated the faster growth in total investment in the 2000s. The growth of equipment investment accelerated across the board, although there were substantial differences across sectors in terms of levels and growth rates. For instance, non-market services and agriculture sectors, despite seeing a consistent increase in the equipment share, maintained a relatively low presence of equipment capital compared with manufacturing, construction, and market services. Regardless, the chapter observed an increasing role of equipment capital in the economy, which helped improve capital composition effects. Capital composition effects are the impact of investment moving towards higher productivity assets, on production, and such impact is generally observed to be positive. Industry decomposition of labour productivity growth shows that aggregate productivity growth was explained majorly by within-industry productivity growth, and between-effect or structural change remained relatively a small contributor."

The dynamic effect, indicating the movement of workers to sectors with faster productivity growth, has been mostly negligible, suggesting that employment has hardly been generated in sectors witnessing faster productivity growth. The major contribution to the aggregate productivity growth has come from the service sector in all the sub-periods, especially immediately after the reform process in India in the 1990s, and in 2008-17."

The largest contributors to aggregate value-added growth for the overall period include agriculture & allied industries and services such as trade, other services, business services, and financial services. While agriculture & allied sector's contribution was due to its high value-added share, the services industries reflected strong value-added shares and high value-added growth.

    "input": "Question: What factors influenced energy intensity and capital intensity trends in Indian manufacturing, and what are the implications for India's emissions reduction goals?",
    "output": "Supplementary econometric analysis of energy intensity trends in Indian manufacturing at the aggregate level revealed that while output had a positive effect on energy consumption, export intensity of Indian manufacturing had a negative effect on energy intensity. This analysis also indicated that since 2011 there were probably several factors that tended to push up the energy intensity\u2014with the fall in real price of energy being one of them. Manufacturing accounts for a little over half of energy consumption of the Indian economy, and the finding that the downward trend in energy consumption in manufacturing halted during 2011-17 is a matter of concern in view of India\u2019s commitment to cut down its emissions intensity. Policy action is thus needed to encourage energy conservation in manufacturing. Chapter 9 discussed trends in capital intensity and suggested a possible impact of factor prices on capital intensity, observing that the Indian economy is increasingly becoming more capital intensive. Capital intensity has been rising in India as the relative price of capital has been falling relative to workers\u2019 wages, apparently making the substitution of labor by capital more attractive to firms. This observation was reinforced through econometric analysis, establishing a positive relationship between wage/rental ratio and capital per worker ratio in the aggregate economy. Many factors, including subsidised technology up -gradation, low custom duties for export-intensive sectors, and rigidities in the labour market, are identified as major factors for capital deepening in the manufacturing sector. However, the high capital-output ratio in Indian industries does not appear to be productivity-enhancing."

    "input": "Question: What trends in capital intensity were revealed by the analysis in Chapter 9, and what implications do they have for job creation in India?",
    "output": "Most previous studies that considered the role of capital intensity in India confined their analysis to manufacturing, specifically the organised manufacturing sector. The analysis in Chapter 9 covered all sectors of the economy, and the results indicated that much of the recent expansion in capital services and capital deepening happened in the market services and construction sectors. Also, a simple comparison of capital intensity growth and labour productivity growth between the 1990s and 2000s in Chapter 9 of this report did not indicate a strong positive association between the two. Therefore, the dynamics in capital intensity and its effect on productivity in various industries, going beyond the manufacturing sector, warrant further research in the future. Indeed, as observed by previous studies, the manufacturing sector also sees a rapid expansion in capital per worker ratio. Yet, it remains a puzzling case, as the relative price of labour in this sector is one of the lowest when compared with other broad sectors of the economy, which is a unique finding in this report. This makes the question of jobless growth in India's manufacturing an even more intriguing question. A comparison of the rising capital intensity in the construction sector with its substantially weak productivity performance also makes us tentatively conclude that the sector fails to translate its disproportionate use of capital into productivity, which is a subject that needs further scrutiny. Earlier research has shown that the construction boom in the Indian economy accompanies a fall in real wages in the sector as the reallocation of workers (largely unskilled workers) from the primary sector adds little to the sector's productivity. Our analysis revealed that the growth rate in capital intensity 1981-2017 was relatively much higher in the following industries: mining and quarrying; textiles, textile products, leather & footwear; coke, refined petroleum products & nuclear fuel; other non-metallic mineral products; trade; education; and health & social work. However, the growth rate in capital intensity was relatively low (even negative in one case) in the following industries: pulp, paper, paper products, printing & publishing; electrical & optical equipment; transport & storage; financial services; and \u2018other services\u2019. Regarding the trends at the aggregate economy level, the annual growth rate in capital intensity was much higher during 2003-17 (over 6.5 per cent) than observed for the periods 1981-1993 and 1994-2002. This accelerated growth in capital intensity had obvious adverse implications for job creation. It is particularly important to note that annual employment growth at the economy level between 2011 and 2017 was negative at about (-) 0.2 per cent, while it was positive between 1999 and 2011 at about 1.4 per cent. With an increasing number of youths entering the job market in the coming years, negative employment growth is an obvious matter of concern. The explanation for the marked rise in the growth rate in capital intensity in the period 2003-17 probably lies mainly, or at least in part, in an increase in the growth rate in real wages. Econometric evidence presented in Chapter 9 does point in that direction\u2014a positive effect of real wages on capital intensity is found from an analysis of aggregate economy level time series data and an analysis of panel data for manufacturing industries. This research finding does not provide any indication that the elasticity of capital intensity in manufacturing with respect to real wage rate increased during 2003-17 compared with the period 1980-2002, which could have provided a partial explanation for the observed significant hike in the growth rate in capital intensity in the economy during 2003-17. However, a close examination of the data reveals that the annual average growth rate in real wages across 13 manufacturing industries rose from 1.6 per cent during 1981-93 and about 3 per cent during 1994-2002 to as high as 6.1 per cent during 2003-17. A positive effect of real wages on capital intensity is found from an analysis of aggregate economy level time series data and an analysis of panel data for manufacturing industries."

    "input": "Question: What policy actions are necessary to offset the adverse impact on job creation caused by the rapid growth in capital intensity of production, particularly in manufacturing?",
    "output": "Appropriate policy action is needed to offset partly the adverse impact on job creation caused by the rapid growth in capital intensity of production, particularly in manufacturing. This will help create more jobs than what is expected to happen otherwise. One possible area of policy action lies in the containment of growth in prices of wage goods such as food prices. Arguably, this may help control the growth in real wages, which in turn could help labour-intensive industries maintain cost competitiveness and retain their place in the economy, especially, in the face of import competition. A second and more promising area of policy action lies in promotion of medium, small and micro enterprises (MSMEs). The contribution of such enterprises towards job creation is well recognised. However, expanding MSME sector in India is challenging in a global economic situation marked by recessionary conditions and intense competition in global markets. It is important to devise strategies to help the MSME sector to become capable of competing in global value chains. This obviously calls for appropriate policy for further promotion of MSMEs with support for improving their competitiveness. Perhaps, with suitably substantive attention to technology development in MSMEs, and enhanced access to credit and financial support for improving their competitiveness, it may be possible to impart a major boost to this segment of Indian manufacturing and thus help create a significantly higher number of jobs."

    "output": "India and China have attracted much attention in recent growth literature. Despite shifting from socialist pasts to market economies, their structural transformation has been different. India's growth was marked by a significant acceleration of its service sector, while China's growth is largely driven by the manufacturing sector. A comparison of the proximate sources of economic growth in India and China, i.e., the role of capital accumulation and total factor productivity in driving labor productivity growth, documented a substantial improvement in the labor productivity performance in the two countries during their post-market reform period. However, the two economies still have labor productivity levels far below the global frontiers, and even more importantly, their productivity levels are still the lowest compared with other emerging market peers. China's faster productivity growth in the non-service industries has helped it improve overall productivity levels much faster than India, widening the productivity gap between the two countries. China's aggressive reforms since the late 1970s\u2014tapping its cheap labor force, tend to have helped its industrial sector flourish over the years. India's service sector, however, performed relatively better than China over the years, even though much of India's economic reforms since the 1990s focussed on the manufacturing sector."

    "output": "The global financial crisis seems to have affected productivity growth in both India and China, although the impact was larger on China. In general, China's labor productivity performance was relatively better in all the industry groups we considered, with the exception of the financial and business services sectors in the 1994-2002 period and non-market services through the entire 1981-2017 period. However, labor productivity growth in India's industrial sector\u2014both the manufacturing and non-manufacturing industries\u2014gained some momentum during the five years prior to the global financial crisis, although it remained lower than that of China. During this period, China not only continued its high labor productivity growth in manufacturing but also gained a significant surge in its market services productivity growth. However, both countries lost steam in the post-crisis period\u2014India's productivity growth weakened in the industrial sector and China's in market services. Nonetheless, the aggregate labor productivity in India has remained largely unchanged in the post-crisis years\u2014thanks to rising productivity in agriculture and non-market services, while China witnessed a notable fall in its productivity growth.\n\nThe analysis revealed that the difference in the growth of capital per worker is the foremost factor that explains the differences in labor productivity growth between the two economies. This observation is consistent with recent evidence that attributes the growth divergence between the two economies from the 1980s to China's rapid progress in investment. The gap in TFP growth was also observed to be as important as capital deepening, while the differences in the rate of improvement in labor quality had less of a role in explaining the differences in labor productivity growth between the two countries. The chapter documented the dominance of capital deepening in both countries in driving their labor productivity growth, although it varied over time and across industries. The role of labor quality in driving labor productivity growth was moderately higher in China in most industries, except in manufacturing, trade, and business services. However, in aggregate, the contribution of labor quality to productivity growth was somewhat comparable between the two economies.\n\nIn terms of differences in TFP growth between the two countries, it was evident that China's industrial sector performed much better than India over the entire period of analysis. With its better TFP growth in agriculture and industry, China maintained a higher TFP growth than India in the aggregate economy over the last 40 years, although its performance in the service sector was worse than in India. However, the interesting feature of the service sector's dominance in India's TPF growth compared with China was the role of non-market services, while the performance of market services in the two economies over the entire period was quite comparable. The analysis also revealed that both countries followed an uneven industry pattern of aggregate TFP growth. While some industries grew beyond their relative size, others underperformed. Moreover, a widespread decline in TFPG in Chinese industries caused erosion in its aggregate TFP growth in the post-crisis period compared with India."

    "output": "The chapter examined the marginal impact of capital deepening and labour quality on labour productivity in India and China. The results indicated higher marginal productivity of capital in Chinese manufacturing compared with India, whereas the marginal impact of labour quality was higher in India's service sector. Earlier in the chapter, it was observed that the contribution of labour quality growth to the observed labour productivity growth in the two countries is relatively small and comparable, but the econometric analysis tends to suggest that the relative impact of a unit change in labour quality on labour productivity is higher in India's service sector. This is largely consistent with India's service-driven growth story that has been established in the previous literature. The results may suggest the importance of upskilling workers in India to have a larger productivity impact. As observed by previous literature, India's early efforts to invest heavily in educational institutions offer the potential for future development in this regard. However, additional efforts are required to support the development of workers' skill intensity and improve human capital to translate India's growing demographic dividend into economic opportunity. Moreover, to improve worker productivity, reducing the gap with global frontiers, it is also essential to continue investing in modern technologies and high value-added activities. This is also true for China, even as it is going through a severe domestic transformation from investment-led growth to consumer-driven growth."

    "input": "Question: What is the significance of intangible investment in advanced economies and how does it relate to productivity measurement, especially in the context of India KLEMS?",
    "output": "Evidence suggests that the importance of intangible investment in advanced economies has been rising rapidly, overtaking even the pace of investment in intangible assets. With the rise in globalisation and rapid changes in technology, staying innovative was essential for firms to remain competitive and profitable, which seems to be a reason behind the acceleration in intangible investment. Intangible investment has been a key factor in explaining inequality and productivity stagnation in the west. Earlier studies have shown that capitalisation of intangible assets generally raises labour productivity growth and lowers measured TFP growth in advanced economies. More recent studies provide evidence on how the use of intangibles in the production process and the failure to account for this properly in one\u2019s analysis can lead to the mismeasurement of productivity. As firms adopt new general-purpose technologies, TFP is likely understated in the early phases as the primary inputs of capital and labour are used to accumulate intangible capital. In the subsequent phases, as the intangibles create measurable output, productivity is likely overstated, thus resulting in a productivity J-curve.\nIndeed, the measurement of intangible investment is a challenging exercise, even for advanced economies with well-developed statistics. Broadly defining, intangible investment includes investment in design, branding, research and development (R&D), and software. The importance of intangible investment was recognised by the international system of national accounts (SNA) in 1993 and further broadened under the name of intellectual property products (IP) in SNA 2008. The latest national accounts revisions in India also adopt the SNA revisions to include IP products in the list of capital assets.\nIt is very important for India to understand the trends in intangible investment, especially given the recent fall in tangible investment to GDP ratio. For instance, if investment in intangible assets complement the weakening tangible investment, we are missing an important part of the capital in our measurement. In such a case, we are likely to understate the volume of capital stock and its rental values, which has important implications for productivity measurement. More micro-level evidence also suggests the importance of investment in intangibles such as managerial capabilities, contributing to higher productivity performance. One feasible and important extension of the India KLEMS that may be explored in the future is to include intangible assets in the capital input. The recent national accounts revisions provide some broad measures of intangible assets (e.g., intellectual property rights, software, etc.), which can be a starting point for constructing a series of investments in intangible assets."

    "output": "The rising share of ICT assets in total investment will have important implications for rental prices and, therefore, for capital services, as the pace of aggregate capital service growth will be larger due to faster depreciation rates and higher marginal productivity of ICT assets than the non-ICT ones. The use of ICT in the production process has significant productivity spillover, impacting productivity through new technologies, network externalities, organizational changes, and lower transaction costs, as well as rapid improvements in productivity of ICT producing industries. A comprehensive analysis of the effect of ICT, in particular of ICT investment, on productivity and growth is seldom available due to the lack of data on investment in ICT in Indian industries. Recent revisions of the National Accounts provide estimates of investment in software and ICT equipment by broad industry groups, making it feasible to combine these estimates with industry-level estimates available from the Annual Survey of Industries and NSSO unorganized manufacturing, which the India KLEMS database may explore to refine the estimates of capital input in the database."

    "input": "Question: What is the significance of the informal sector in the Indian economy, and how has the KLEMS database approached its analysis?",
    "output": "The informal sector plays a significant role in the Indian economy, especially in creating jobs and providing incomes for a large portion of its workforce. This segment of the economy is often argued to be less productive than its formal counterparts. While there are two perspectives on the existence of the informal sector in India\u2014one arguing that it is a means of exploitation, and the other considering it a channel of economic dynamism\u2014its inimical impact on overall productivity is less contested. Existing evidence also points to the role of economic reforms in India in intensifying the productivity differential between formal and informal firms, with the latter being relatively less efficient. The KLEMS database has not formally considered the dual structure of the Indian economy while analyzing productivity in various industries. Indeed, attempts to do basic productivity analysis for the manufacturing sector, distinguishing between the formal and informal segments, have been made by the KLEMS researchers in the past years. Extending the formal-informal split to other industries, especially to several market services such as retail services, is of high importance as these segments play a substantial role in job creation in the Indian economy. At the same time, it is also extremely challenging and resource intensive."

    "output": "The importance of productivity is viewed from multiple angles. For instance, it is often associated with improving production efficiency, hence helping to improve the competitiveness of industries and firms. On the other hand, from a pure welfare perspective, productivity is considered an economy's ability to produce more output per unit of input (say for instance, output per person) and to consume at less cost. This indeed enhances welfare, measured in terms of consumer purchasing power, and thus the long -term living standards of people."

    "input": "Question: How do sectoral productivity improvements affect poverty reduction, and what factors influence the net impact of productivity on poverty and welfare?",
    "output": "Sectoral productivity improvements are argued to have important implications for poverty reduction (Ivanic and Martin, 2018). In particular, the role of rising productivity in agriculture in reducing poverty in less developed economies has often been highlighted in the literature (Ivanic and Martin, 2018; Bart et al., 2008; Irz et al., 2001). When farm productivity increases, it helps per capita yield for farm workers, raising their real wages and welfare. With its large presence of workers in the farm sector, the substantial potential for growth-enhancing structural change, the impact of sectoral productivity growth in poverty reduction in India is an important aspect to consider in future research.\nA related question in this context is also the distribution of productivity gains between the two factors of production, labour, and capital. If productivity gains are allocated in favour of labour, the poverty-reducing impact of productivity is likely to be more prevalent. Similarly, participation in the global value chain and whether the gains of productivity are absorbed domestically or exported are essential aspects to consider in this context. In the latter case, again, the poverty-reducing impact is likely to be minimal than the former. The net impact of productivity on poverty reduction and welfare will depend upon the allocation of productivity gains between workers and capital, and domestic and external, understanding which may need additional research involving adequate methodology and complementary data."

    "output": "The India KLEMS database covers 27 industries, aggregated into six broad sectors: Agriculture, Hunting, Forestry and Fishing; Mining and Quarrying; Manufacturing; Electricity, Gas and Water supply; Construction; and Services. Table 1.1 lists the 27 industries, including the higher aggregates, with detailed classification and concordance of study industries with NICs available in Version 8 of the manual published in 2022. Table 1.2 provides an overview of all the series included in our database. Measures of Capital (K), Labour (L), Energy (E), Material (M) and Service (S) inputs as well as Gross Output (GO), have been constructed using National Accounts Statistics (NAS), Annual Survey of Industries (ASI), NSSO rounds and Input -Output (IO) Tables. In building annual time series on gross output, five inputs and factor income shares, various assumptions are made to fill up gaps in industry details and link series over time. As we know that NSSO rounds of unregistered manufacturing, Input Output Transaction Tables, and Employment and Unemployment Surveys by NSSO are available only for certain benchmark years., the use of information from these data sources necessitates interpolation and assumption of constant shares for building series of output and inputs. Further the construction of growth accounting series like total factor productivity, labour productivity, etc. are based on theoretical models of production and needs additional assumptions that are spelt out in subsequent chapters of the manual. Finally, the other Series like NDP at factor cost, compensation of employees, etc. are additional series which are used in generating the growth accounts and are informative by themselves."

The National Accounts Statistics (NAS) brought out by the NSO (National Statistics Office, Government of India) is the basic source of data for the construction of series on gross value added for INDIA KLEMS industries. Up to 2011-12, estimates of GVA at both current and constant (2011-12) prices for all industries are obtained from Back Series of National Accounts (Base 2011-12). For years after 2011-12, they are directly obtained from NAS 2022. However, NAS estimates of value added are not available for a few India KLEMS industry groups, requiring some aggregate industry groups from NAS to be split. Maintaining consistency with NAS, the value-added data in India KLEMS is measured at basic price.\n\nThe construction of Gross valued added series involves three steps:\nStep 1: A concordance table between the classification used in the NAS and the 27 study industry classification used for this project has been prepared. Further, concordance between all the 27 sectors has been constructed with NIC - 1970, 1987, 1998, 2004 and 2008. Out of the 27 study industries, for 20 industries, GVA series both in current and constant prices is directly taken from NAS. The sectors for which data are provided in NAS are Agriculture, Forestry & logging, Fishing, Mining and Quarrying, Manufacturing, Electricity, gas and water supply, Construction, Trade, Hotels & Restaurants, Railways, Transport by other means, Storage, Communication, Banking & insurance, Real estate, Ownership of Dwelling & Business Services, Public Administration & Defense and Other Services.\nStep 2: For manufacturing industries where direct estimates of GVA were not available from NAS, estimates have been made using additional information from ASI and NSSO unorganized manufacturing data. In these cases, GVA data is constructed by splitting the NAS data using ASI or NSSO distributions. ASI data (annual) has been used for registered and corporate manufacturing whereas interpolated ratios from NSSO 40th (1984-85), 45th (1989-90), 51st (1994-95), 56th (2000-01) 62nd (2005-06), 67th round (2010-11) and 73rd round (2015-16) rounds have been used for."

However, the Back Series with base 2011 -12, which is the source of GVA in India KLEMS database 2022 , does not provide estimates of GVO for most of the industries except for Agriculture, Mining and Quarrying and Construction. For these three industries GVO data at current and constant prices directly obtained from Back Series with base 2011-12. Therefore, for 1980-81 to 2011-12 period, the GVO series for remaining 24 industries at current and constant prices are estimated by applying the respective GVO/GVA ratio for current and constant prices obtained from Back Series with base 2004 -05 and NAS 2014 to GVA with 2011-12 base. For years since 2011, the estimates of GVO both at current and constant prices for all industries are taken directly from NAS 2022. (a) Filling procedures of National Accounts series : It is to be noted that the NAS estimates of gross output for a few industry groups are at a more aggregate level, requiring splitting of the aggregates.  In such cases, NAS estimates of output have been split using additional information from Annual Survey of Industries and NSSO rounds of Unregistered Manufacturing to obtain estimates at higher level of disaggregation. Secondly, for Unregistered manufacturing gross output data is available in NAS from 2004 -05 onwards. In this case,  information from NSSO survey rounds has been used for missing years to derive output estimates of unregistered manufacturing industries at current and constant prices. As mentioned earlier, for gross value-added series of service sectors estimates are obtained from NAS. However, prior to 2011-12 National Accounts do not provide any estimates of gross output"

    "output": "Prior to 2011-12 National Accounts do not provide any estimates of gross output of service sectors and hence India KLEMS relies on Input output transaction tables (from which the ratio of gross to value added is computed which is then applied to GVA reported in NAS) which are available at an interval of 5 years or so. This necessitates interpolation and assumption of constant shares for measuring output of services sectors. The Input Output Transaction Tables for Benchmark years of 1978-79, 1983-84, 1989-90, 1993-94, 1998-99, 2003-04 and 2007-08 are used to derive gross output series for service sectors.\n\nThe construction of the gross output series at current and constant prices involves the following steps:\n\nStep 1: Measuring Gross Output of Agricultural Sector, Mining and Quarrying, and Construction. NAS provides nominal and real GVO series for a) Crops and Plantation, b) Animal Husbandry c) Forestry and Logging d) Fishing. By aggregating the GVO of these four subsectors we derive the GVO of Agricultural sector. The Gross output estimates of Mining and Quarrying and Construction at current and constant prices from 1980-2019 is also directly taken from NAS.\n\nStep 2: Measuring Gross Output of Manufacturing Industries. Since 2011-12, gross output data for 7 out of 13 manufacturing industries listed in table 3.1 are directly picked up from NAS. The industries are Food Products, Beverages and Tobacco; Textiles, Textile Products, Leather and Footwear; Wood and Products of wood; Pulp, Paper, Paper products, Printing and Publishing; Coke, Refined Petroleum Products and Nuclear fuel; Chemicals and Chemical Products; and Rubber and Plastic Products. For the remaining 6 sectors output is constructed by splitting the NAS output data using ASI or NSSO distributions. ASI data (annual) has been used for registered manufacturing whereas."

    "output": "This chapter discusses the construction of labour input for 27 industries from 1980-81 to 2020-21. Labour input captures both the quantity of labour (i.e. number of persons) and quality of labour over time. Labour quality is measured based on educational qualification and wage rates of the workers within each of the 27 industries. Given the limitations of India\u2019s employment statistics (Sivasubramonian; 2004 , & Himanshu; 2011, Ghose; 2016), especially the availability of information on wages/ earnings of different category of workers across industries, the database provides only the labour quality index based on five different education categories. Labour input is measured by multiplying the number of persons employed by the index of labour quality which captures the human capital embodied in the labour, constructed separately for each industry. The 38th to 68th rounds of the Employment and Unemployment Survey (EUS) by India\u2019s National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) conducted between 1983 and 2011 -12, respectively, and the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) rounds of 2017-18, 2018 -19, 2019-20 and 2020 -21 by National Statistical Organization (NSO) are the main sources data for estimating labour input. Additionally, for estimating India\u2019s population growth rate, we used India\u2019s decadal census and country-wise population growth rates by the World Bank. The total employment, measured by the number of persons engaged in each of the 27 industries in India is computed as follows: 1. First, the concordance between 27 KLEMS industries was built with each of NIC-1970, 1987, 1998 and 2008, separately. 2. Based on each round of EUS and PLFS, the distributions of workers by UPSS 2 across the four components - Rural Male, Rural Female, Urban Male and Urban Female were obtained . These distributions of workers were then multiplied with the all-India figures for the number of workers for each of the years of EUS and PLFS rounds. 3. The all -India figures for the number of workers are generally not directly available from any official sources. We obtain the official estimates of worker-population ratios (WPR) from each of the EUS."

    "output": "The total employment, measured by the number of persons engaged in each of the 27 industries in India, is computed as follows:\n\n1.  First, the concordance between 27 KLEMS industries was built with each of NIC-1970, 1987, 1998 and 2008, separately.\n2.  Based on each round of EUS and PLFS, the distributions of workers by UPSS across the four components - Rural Male, Rural Female, Urban Male and Urban Female were obtained. These distributions of workers were then multiplied with the all-India figures for the number of workers for each of the years of EUS and PLFS rounds.\n3.  The all-India figures for the number of workers are generally not directly available from any official sources. Official estimates of worker-population ratios (WPR) are obtained from each of the survey rounds and multiply them with India\u2019s total population for the survey year. India\u2019s population for the survey years is obtained by interpolating India\u2019s decadal census populations.\n4.  For 2017-18, 2018-19 and 2019-20, the all-India figures for number of employed persons were available from the Government of India. These figures were directly used in the estimates.\n5.  For 2020-21, India\u2019s total population was projected using the annual population growth rates for India provided by the World Bank. The World Bank estimates were scaled up with the same proportion by which India\u2019s population growth rate in 2011-12 based on the latest Census Report exceeded that of World Bank estimates.\n6.  Finally, Lij is obtained for each industry where i=1 for rural and 2 for urban sectors, and j=1 for male and 2 for female for each round.\n7.  Total persons employed in a year were then obtained for each industry as the sum of the Lij over gender and sectors, i.e., \u03a3i\u03a3jLij .\n8.  The estimates of employment for the intervening years between each of the EUS and PLFS rounds are obtained by simple interpolation across the four segments - rural male, rural females, urban male and the urban females for all of the 27 industries separately.\n9.  The mid-points of the surveys are around the mid-year of the survey rounds, i.e July for 38th round and 1st Jan for the other rounds; whereas the interpolation has been centered around 1st October which is the mid-year of the national income estimates. Hence, the base is shifted to October of each year while interpolating the values. This is done to coincide the survey year mid-point to the mid-point of financial year.\nFor extrapolation backward to 1980-81 to 1982-83, the interpolation of the broad industrial classifications of 32nd round (1977-78) and 38thround (1983-84) are used. Thus, the estimates from 32nd round are mainly used as control numbers. Between 2005 and 2011, a very high growth rate in number of employed persons series for the industry Electrical and Optical Equipment was observed as compared to other manufacturing industries, and the overall growth in employment in this industry during 2005-2011 was found to be higher than that for Construction. It was also observed that there was a negative growth in employment in Textiles, Textile Products, Leather and Footwear although real GVA of this industry more than doubled between 2005 and 2011. To address these issues, some adjustments to the initial employment estimates for Electrical & Optical Equipment and Textiles, Textile Products, Leather and Footwear have been done. Onwards 2005, employment series for Electrical & Optical Equipment has been estimated applying annual growth rates obtained from ASI and NSSO rounds to the number of employed persons for the year 2005-06. Then, for the years 2005-06 to 2011-12, we compute the difference between estimated employment series from EUS rounds and that based on ASI & NSSO rounds for the Electrical and Optical Equipment industry and add it to Textiles."

    "output": "To ensure consistency in manufacturing estimates obtained from EUS rounds, the employment series for Electrical & Optical Equipment has been estimated by applying annual growth rates from ASI and NSSO rounds to the number of employed persons for the year 2005-06. The difference between estimated employment series from EUS rounds and that based on ASI & NSSO rounds for the Electrical and Optical Equipment industry is then added to the Textiles, Textile Products, Leather and Footwear industry.\n\nThe quality of the labour force is important for productivity measurement, and changes in labour quality can be captured using the methodology given by Jorgenson, Gollop and Fraumeni (JGF) (1987). The index of aggregate labour quality measures the changes in the composition of labour in the economy. In this study, the labour quality index is computed using only education characteristics in the JGF methodology. The data required is employment and earnings by education and by industry, specifically using five education categories: up to primary, primary, middle, secondary & higher secondary, and above higher secondary. Quality growth rates are estimated for total persons employed in 27 industries in India for the 38th, 50th, 55th, 61st, 68th rounds of EUS by NSSO, and all the PLFS rounds up to 2020-21, indexed to 1983. Interpolation is done for intermediate years, and the series is extrapolated backwards from 1983 to 1980-81 and recomputed with base 1980-81 equal to 100. The following steps have been performed:\n\n1.  Compute the distribution of persons employed by the five educational groups for all the 27 industries for the selected major rounds of EUS and PLFS.\n2.  Apply these proportions to the number of employed persons in different industries in the major rounds and PLFS to obtain the distribution of persons by education groups.\n3.  Estimate the earnings data from NSO which relates to mainly the regular and casual persons employed. It may however be mentioned that even for these two groups, for a large number of persons employed, the wages are either missing or given as zero.

    "output": "To estimate the earnings for self-employed persons, a Mincer wage equation is used, corrected for sample selection bias using Heckman\u2019s two-step procedure. The Mincer function is applied to the earnings of casual and regular employees, regressing earnings on factors like age, gender, education, location, marital status, social exclusion, and industry. The corresponding earnings of the self-employed are obtained as the predicted value with similar traits.

This chapter outlines the methodology employed to estimate capital Services for the 27 industries. The estimation of capital service growth rate is accomplished by first estimating capital stock for different assets, and then aggregating them across assets after correcting for the differences in their marginal productivities. To measure capital services, using the Jorgenson and Griliches (1967) approach, we need estimates of capital stock for detailed asset types and the shares of each of these assets in total capital remuneration. The aggregate capital services growth rate is derived as a weighted growth rate of individual capital assets, the weights being the shares of each asset in the total compensation made to capital."

    "output": "According to the Jorgenson and Griliches (1967) approach, the important components of capital service measure are the asset wise capital stock, \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc58,\ud835\udc61 and the service price (rental price) of capital assets, \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc58,\ud835\udc61\n\ud835\udc3e, where \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc58,\ud835\udc61\n\ud835\udc3e  is the rental or user cost of capital asset type k in year t. Therefore, the numerator, which is the product of user cost of asset k and the capital stock of asset k, is the capital compensation received by asset k. The numerator is the sum of compensation received by assets, or the total capital compensation, and therefore \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc58,\ud835\udc61 is the share of asset k in total capital compensation. Under the neoclassical assumption of price -marginal product equality, it effectively incorporates the productivity or qualitative differences in the contribution of various asset types to aggregate capital services, as the composition of aggregate capital stock in any industry changes (see Jorgenson, 2001). For instance, as the marginal productivity of ICT capital is higher than that of other assets, a change in the composition of capital towards ICT capital will result in higher capital services, which will be captured by a larger value of the v for ICT assets. Assuming a geometric depreciation rate, \ud835\udeff\ud835\udc58 which is constant over time, but different for each asset type, capital stock in asset k in year t can be constructed using Perpetual Inventory Method (PIM) as: \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc58,\ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc58,\ud835\udc61\u22121(1 \u2212 \ud835\udeff\ud835\udc58) + \ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc58,\ud835\udc61, where, \ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc58,\ud835\udc61 is the real investment in asset type k in period t. Once we have the estimates of capital stock for each asset and the growth rates of aggregate capital services, we can calculate the capital composition effect (\u2206 ln \ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc44\ud835\udc61) - or the effect of changing as set composition of capital stock. This can be obtained as \u2206 ln \ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc44\ud835\udc61 = \u2206 ln \ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc61 \u2212 \u2206 ln \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc61, where \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc61 = \u2211 \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc58,\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc58 . These growth rates can then be indexed to the base year to obtain a capital composition index(\ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc44\ud835\udc61), i.e. \ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc44\ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc44\ud835\udc61\u22121 \u00d7 e (\u2206 ln \ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc61\u2212\u2206 ln \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc61) for t>base year, and \ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc44\ud835\udc61 = 100 for t=base year.

    "output": "The construction of the India KLEMS database on capital services utilizes several sources of information, including the National Accounts Statistics (NAS), which provides information on broad sectors of the economy; the Annual Survey of Industries (ASI), covering the organized manufacturing sector; the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) rounds for unorganized manufacturing; and various Input-Output tables. The final estimates are fully consistent with the aggregate data obtained from the NAS. The approach to capital measurement is consistent with international practices such as the EU KLEMS, which ensures the possibility of international comparisons. The data for asset-wise investment are obtained from the CSO for detailed data on assets and industries. For sectors where investment matrices were unavailable from the CSO, information is gathered from other sources like ASI for organized manufacturing and NSSO surveys for unorganized manufacturing, benchmarked to the aggregate investment series from the National Accounts. The data used in the current version of the India KLEMS is based on the revised NAS with 2011-2012 as the base and is available only since 2012. For earlier years, the series are extrapolated using growth rates from previous versions of the data. Investment in education and health are obtained directly from national accounts for the period after 2012, for each asset. For years before 2012, the trend in the distribution of output is assumed to split the total investment in the aggregates of these sectors into sub-sectors."

For the Public Sector, NAS Asset Types include Buildings*, Other construction*, Transport Equipment, Machinery & Equipment, Software (1999-00 onwards), and ICT equipment (2012 onwards); the India KLEMS Asset Types are Construction, Construction, Transport Equipment, and Machinery & Equipment for all asset types. For the Private Sector, NAS Asset Types include Residential buildings, Non-residential building, Other construction, Machinery & Equipment (incl. transport equipment), Software (1999-00 onwards), and ICT equipment (2012 onwards); the India KLEMS Asset Types are Construction for the building types, Machinery & Equipment (transport equipment is excluded later*), and Machinery & Equipment for the software and ICT equipment. Note: The asset categories listed in this table are available for the period 1950-2016, for which detailed asset-industry data was obtained from the CSO. For years after 2016, when the published version of national accounts was relied on, the asset groupings are limited to dwellings, other buildings & structures, machinery & equipment (including transport equipment), intellectual property, and cultivated biological resources. Detailed data on intangible investment, such as intellectual property rights, R&D, and mineral exploration and evaluation, are also available in the 2012 base NAS data for the period 2011-2016. These are included in machinery assets in the KLEMS asset group, as they cannot be separated from earlier versions of the data. * Buildings and other construction include dwellings, non-residential buildings, roads & bridges, and other construction. ** Software and ICT are included in the machinery and equipment, as ICT and non -ICT assets are not distinguished in this version. *** Transport equipment was not separately available for the private sector, and therefore, it was imputed and subtracted from machinery and equipment (See main text). Also, transport equipment was not separately available for both public and private sectors since 2016, and therefore, a fixed proportion of transport equipment to total machinery and equipment from 2016 was used. In some years transport equipment was provided as part of the machinery and equipment, categorized as \u2018tools, transport equipment and other fixed assets. In such cases, the transport/tools, transport and other fixed asset ratio in the nearest year was used to separate transport equipment."

    "output": "Total investment in each asset category is calculated as the sum of private and public sector investment in each asset. Investment in transport equipment was not available separately for the private sector industries. Therefore, the NAS total machinery in the private sector was distributed using the industry distribution of machinery and transport equipment. These estimates are then subtracted from each industry\u2019s total machinery & transport equipment data to obtain the transport equipment investment in the private sector industries. Using this approach, investment in transport equipment by industries was generated for the period 1950-2016. The share of transport equipment in the total machinery and equipment group in 2016-2017 was assumed to remain constant to create nominal investment in transport equipment in the subsequent years, and the nominal investment was deflated using GFCF deflator for transport equipment.\n\nSince the distinction between registered and unregistered manufacturing is not available in the NAS since 2016, a quick fix was used to split these two. NAS provides a division between the corporate sector, public sector, and household sector. In the current version of the data, the household sector is considered as a proxy for unregistered and the corporate and public sector as a proxy for the registered sector.\n\nUpdates for years since 2017-2018 are solely based on published aggregate GFCF data from the National Accounts. In the 2020 version of the data, the published NAS series is considered as the benchmark since 2012. Then the industry distribution of the 2012-2016 detailed series obtained previously from the CSO is applied. NAS provides data only for 9 broad sectors, while India KLEMS has 27 industries, which necessitated further splitting of some of the NAS sectors. This includes aggregate manufacturing (registered and unregistered separately for the period 1950-2016) with 13 sub sectors; other services into 4 sub sectors; and real estate activities and business services into 2 sub sectors. The manufacturing sector investment data was disaggregated into 13 subsectors at the 2-digit level of NIC 1998 using ASI and NSSO data."

    "input": "Question: How is aggregate capital formation split in the organized manufacturing sector, according to the study?",
    "output": "In order to split the aggregate capital formation in organized manufacturing sector into 13 study sectors, the Annual Survey of Industries (ASI) is used. ASI defines Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) as actual additions (newly purchased, second hand and own construction) minus deductions plus depreciation adjustment for discarded assets during the year. This approach is based on a single year\u2019s sample and helps to avoid potential huge negative investment series, and is also consistent with published ASI GFCF series. The yearly detailed volumes beginning 1964-65 were used to derive the gross fixed capital formation by asset type directly. For the years 1964-1978, the relevant data are obtained from published detailed volumes. For the period, 1983-84 to 2004-05 ASI has generated detailed tables from Block C of ASI schedule that contain data on fixed assets. Data for missing years are interpolated using the changes in investment using book value method. Once investment in each of these assets and industries are generated using ASI data, this industry-asset distribution is applied to the published aggregate NAS GFCF series for organized manufacturing sector. From 1960-61 to 1971-72, ASI data are for the census sector and from 1973-74 onwards they are for the factory sector. In order to make these two series comparable over years, the data prior to 1972 is converted to factory sector."

    "output": "For registered manufacturing, investment data for 13 manufacturing sectors by asset types is obtained and adjusted to be consistent with the NAS aggregate. This is done by using the factory/census ratio in 1973 to adjust the data, and after 2016, the sum of the public and corporate sectors is used as a proxy since NAS no longer provides aggregate registered manufacturing data. For unregistered manufacturing, data is obtained from various rounds of NSSO surveys on unorganized manufacturing, covering the period 1989-2016. These surveys provide net addition to owned assets, which is used as a measure of investment. The investment series are then interpolated to obtain annual time series, and the asset-industry distribution is applied to the published NAS aggregate GFCF in unregistered manufacturing to obtain NAS consistent GFCF by asset type and industries.\n\nTo compute asset-wise capital stock and rental price, asset-wise investment price deflators are required. These deflators are derived from CSO investment data by industries and assets in current and constant prices, with a base of 2011-2012. For years before 2011, prices were spliced using 2004-2005 base investment deflators. For transport equipment in 2017-2018, the investment deflator from 2016-2017 was extrapolated using the trend in the investment price of total machinery & equipment from NAS."

    "output": "For manufacturing sectors, the net fixed capital stock is taken for the year 1964, while for non-manufacturing sectors, the same is taken for the year 1950.  Since the NAS estimate is available only for broad sectors and for aggregate capital, the industry-asset distribution of GFCF is used in order to create net fixed capital stock estimates by asset type for all the 27 sectors.  In the 2020 version of the India KLEMS database, the approach to split asset-wise capital stock is changed to using the distribution of net capital stock by assets, available from the detailed asset data obtained from the CSO, instead of using the GFCF distribution. NAS also provides detailed tables on assumed life of assets used for computing capital stock, for private units, administrative units as well as departmental and non-departmental units by asset types.  These estimates of lifetime are used to derive appropriate depreciation rates for non-ICT assets, using a double declining balance rate, assuming 80 years of lifetime for buildings, 20 years for transport equipment, and 25 years for machinery and equipment. The depreciation rates used in the study are given in Table 5.3 by asset type. Subsequently, the capital stock series are built by asset types for all the 27 industries using the GFCF series from 1950 (1964) onwards for the non -manufacturing (manufacturing) sectors. Capital input is arrived using equation (5.1), for which estimates of rental prices are also required.  Assuming that the flow of capital services is proportional to the capital stock at individual asset level, aggregate capital flows can be obtained using a translog quantity index by weighting growth in the stock of each asset by the average shares of each asset in the value of capital compensation, as in (5.1). The rate of return ( i) in equation (5.4) represents the opportunity cost of capital, and can be measured either as internal."

Although NAS has expanded asset coverage to include software and ICT equipment, more data is needed. Future extensions of the database could explore intangible capital like intellectual property and R&D, following SNA 2008 guidelines.  Two additional challenges arise from the new system of national accounts: the lack of separate data on registered and unregistered manufacturing, addressed by considering the household sector as unregistered and the corporate sector as registered. Also, the lack of separate data on transport equipment and machinery assets might necessitate combining them into a single asset in the long term.  Finally, the debate on using an external versus an internal rate of return remains unsettled, suggesting exploring capital estimates using the internal rate of return."

The rental price is determined by the nominal rate of return, economic depreciation costs, and asset-specific capital gains. The rate of return i can be measured as an internal (ex-post) rate of return or an external (ex-ante) rate of return. India KLEMS uses an external rate of return, proxied by the average of return on government securities and the prime lending rate obtained from the Reserve Bank of India. Ideally, taxes should be included, but this would require data beyond the scope of the database. Empirical evidence suggests that including tax rates has a minor effect on growth rates of capital services and TFPG."

    "output": "In the KLEMS data, the backcasting of NAS data methodologies involves extrapolating the 2011-2012 base nominal GFCF series backwards using growth rates from the 2004-2005 series. In previous versions, each individual industry in the NAS detailed data was extrapolated and then aggregated to the KLEMS sector. For example, if a KLEMS sector consisted of n NAS industries, the nominal GFCF in the 2012 series for each of these n sectors was extrapolated individually backward using the growth rates from the nominal GFCF series from the 2004 version. However, the current 2020 version changes this approach to extrapolate after aggregating detailed data to the KLEMS sector due to significant inconsistencies observed in the detailed industry data for some industries between the two versions of the NAS.

The methodology for measuring industry output, intermediate inputs and value added was developed by Jorgenson, Gallop and Fraumeni (1987) and extended by Jorgenson (1990 a). The cornerstone of this approach is a time series of input output (IO) tables which gives the flows of all commodities in the economy, as well as payments to primary factors. Following a similar approach as explained in Jorgenson et al. (2005, Chapter 4) and Timmer et al. (2010, Chapter 3), the time series on intermediate inputs for the India KLEMS project have been constructed.\nAs in EU KLEMS, this study identifies three main categories of Intermediate inputs which are classified as follows: 1. Energy Input, 2. Material Input, 3. Service Input.\nThe following five energy types (and products) have been classified as the Energy input: 1. Coal and Lignite, 2. Petroleum products, 3. Electricity; (for electricity used in the electricity sector, since there is a good amount of inter-firm sale and purchase of electricity, it has been treated as material rather than as energy), 4.

    "output": "The time series of proportions of Material, Energy, and Service Inputs in Total Intermediate Inputs for each of the 27 industries is projected as follows:\n\n*   For the Benchmark years i.e., 1978, 1983, 1989, 1993, 1998, 2003, 2007 and 2015 proportions of Material Inputs, Energy Inputs, and Service Inputs in Total Intermediate Inputs are calculated.\n*   Similar proportion for intervening years is obtained by linear interpolation of the benchmark proportions.\n*   This gives a time series of proportions of Material, Energy and Service Inputs in Total Intermediate Inputs for each year, from 1980 to 2020.\n*   Thus, using IOTT, the intermediate input vector has been projected for 27 study industries from 1980 to 2020.\n\nThere exists some abnormal fluctuation in the proportions of Material Inputs, Energy Inputs, and Service Inputs in Total Intermediate Inputs for benchmark years. In that case, that specific benchmark proportion is dropped, and adjacent benchmark proportions are linearly interpolated to estimate proportion for intervening years. For the industry \u2018Wood & Wood Products\u2019, proportions of Material Inputs, Energy Inputs, and Service Inputs in Total Intermediate Inputs are estimated from SUT 2015-16 instead of Input Output Transaction Table 2015-16.\n\nFor the industry group \u2018Coke, Refined Petroleum and Nuclear Fuel\u2019, proportions of Material Inputs, Energy Inputs, and Service Inputs in Total Intermediate Inputs are estimated from ASI data instead of Input Output Transaction Table. This has been done because the relevant proportions differed significantly between the input -out tables and ASI, and the latter is believed to be making a more correct assessment of energy inputs used in the Coke and Petroleum products industry.\n\nThe projection of intermediate input vector, using IOTT needs to be consistent with the estimated output from NAS. The Gross Value of Output and the Gross Value Added at current prices calculated from NAS is taken. The difference between GVO and GVA provides the gap between value added and gross output for each year, which reflects the Total Intermediate inputs from NAS (GVO-GVA).

Thus, the projected input vector, has been proportionately adjusted to match the gap between value added and gross output obtained from NAS. This involves two steps: 1. For Benchmark years: Ratio of Total Intermediate inputs from NAS to that from IOTT is adjusted proportionately to the absolute value of Energy Inputs/Material Inputs/Service Inputs obtained from IOTT. 2. For Intervening Years: The interpolated proportions of Energy Inputs, Material Inputs and Services Inputs obtained from IOTT, is applied directly to the total intermediate inputs from NAS to get each inputs share. Steps 1-4: This gives a time series of Material, Energy, and Service Inputs for 27 study Industries from 1980 to 2020 at current prices. Steps 5 and 6 below, explain the methodology for computation of Intermediate Input Series for 27 study Industries from 1980 to 2020 at constant price. The approach followed here is to first form the aggregates of materials, energy and services at current price for each study industry from the benchmark Input Output tables and then develop deflators of Materials, Energy and Service Inputs for each of the 27 study Industries separately. Step 5: Constructing Deflators of Materials, Energy and Service Inputs for 27 study Industries separately \u2022 Deflators are obtained for each of the 115 (IOTT 1989 and 1998) and 130 (IOTT 2007) commodity inputs (each row of the IO Matrix). \u2022 WPI for the period 1980 to 2020 is taken from Office of the Economic Adviser, Ministry of Commerce and Industry. \u2022 Best available Wholesale Price Index is applied to each commodity input in the IOTT. \u2022 In several cases, no proper WPI is available for the sector; hence the best among the available has been chosen. \u2022 In some cases, the right index has been formed from item level indices. \u2022 In some case, one index has been removed from a higher -level aggregate to generate the right index. \u2022 For Electricity as an input entering into the production process of an industry, depending on the nature of economic activity, the right price of electricity has been chosen. For instance, in the case of manufacturing industries, the price of electricity for industry considered, similarly for agriculture the price of electricity for agriculture. \u2022 For natural gas from 2004 to 2020 the price information is taken from Indian Petroleum and Natural Gas Statistics. The detailed method of price index construction for Natural gas for the period can be referred from KLEMS data manual 2021. for 2002-03, the end point of the range is taken.

    "output": "For Service Inputs, since WPI is not available hence implicit GDP deflators from NAS are used. Deflators obtained for different IO sectors have been combined using weights. The weights are based on the column of the relevant study industry in the IO table. This is because; the entries read down industry columns give the commodity inputs of raw -materials and services, which are used to produce outputs of particular industries. We have allowed for changing weights over time i.e., we have used different weights for different time periods. Three IOTT has been used for this purpose \u2013 1989, 1998 and 2007. The price series based on 1989 table has been used from 1980 to 1993, the 1998 table has been used from 1993 to 2003 and the 2007 table has been used for the price series for the period 2 003 to 2020. Once the three series have been formed, these have been spliced. Thus, the IO tables have been used for obtaining the materials, energy and services series for each industry at current prices. The deflators for Material, Energy and Service Inputs for each study industry have been used to deflate the Current price Intermediate Input series to Constant price. Gross Value Added for Agriculture estimated by NAS using double deflated method. Therefore, for the Agriculture sector the deflated value of intermediate input is adjusted to the gap between value added and gross output at constant price.

    "output": "The distribution of income between capital, labor, and intermediate inputs is an important element in growth accounting because income shares, under conditions of competitive markets, can be used to measure the contributions each factor makes towards output growth. Under the assumption of constant returns to scale with two factors of production i.e., labor and capital, the sum of the labor income share and capital income share is 1. The labor income share is defined as the ratio of labor income to GVA. Capital income share is accordingly obtained as one minus labor income share.\n\nThere are no published data on factor income shares in the Indian economy at a detailed disaggregate level. National Accounts Statistics (NAS) of the CSO publishes the NDP series comprising compensation of employees (CE), operating surplus (OS), and mixed income (MI) for the NAS industries. The income of self-employed persons, i.e., mixed income (MI), is not separated into the labor component and capital component of the income. Therefore, to compute the labor income share out of value added, one has to take the sum of the compensation of employees and that part of the mixed income which are wages for labor.\n\nThe computation of labor income share for the 27 study industries involves two steps. First, estimates of CE and MI have to be obtained for each of the 27 study industries from the NAS data, which are available only for the NAS sectors (see Table 7.1). Second, the estimate of mixed income has to be split into labor income and capital income for each industry for each year (except for those industries for which the reported mixed income is zero, for instance, public administration)."

    "input": "Question: What data sources and steps are involved in computing the labor income share for 27 study industries?",
    "output": "The computation of labor income share for the 27 study industries involves using NAS, ASI, and unit level data of survey of unorganized manufacturing enterprises to obtain estimates of CE, OS, and MI for each of the 27 study industries. To split the labor and non-labor components out of the mixed income of self -employed, the unit level data of NSS employment-unemployment survey are used along with the estimates of CE, OS and MI basically obtained from the NAS. The estimation of labor income share for the 27 study industries is done in two steps: First, estimates of CE, OS and MI are obtained for the 27 study Industries. NAS provides estimates of compensation of employees (CE), operating surplus (OS) and mixed income (MI) for the 9 NAS industries. For some industries under study, for instance (i) Agriculture, forestry & logging and fishing, (ii) Mining & Quarrying, (iii) Electricity, gas and water supply and (iv) Construction, the required data are readily available from NAS. For others, the estimates available in NAS have to be distributed across the study industries using ASI data. The NAS estimates of factor incomes (CE) for registered manufacturing is split into KLMES 13 industries (3-15) in proportion to the reported ASI data on emoluments for various industries. Estimate of factor incomes for \u2018other services\u2019 in NAS has been split into estimates for (i) Education, (ii) Health and Social Work, and (iii) Other Community, Social and Personal Services including Renting of Machinery and Business Services, and Private Household with Employed Persons. Before 2011 -12, NAS provides estimates of factor incomes for registered manufacturing and unregistered manufacturing, but not for individual manufacturing industries. However, 2011 -12 onwards NAS disaggregated the manufacturing sector in corporate sector and household sector.  The NAS estimates of factor incomes for registered manufacturing and corporate sector have to be split into various manufacturing industries considered in the study (13 in number) using ASI data. The reported CE in NAS for registered manufacturing and corporate sector has been distributed into those 13 industries in proportion to the reported ASI data on emoluments for various industries. Note: *Study Industry \u2018Other Services\u2019 includes Real Estate Activities; Other Community, Social and Personal Services, Private Household with Employed Persons."

    "output": "For estimating Compensation of Employees (CE), Operating Surplus (OS) and Mixed Income (MI) for the 27 study industries, the following procedure is used: Using ASI data, the estimate of OS for registered manufacturing and corporate sector has been distributed. Emoluments are subtracted from gross value added for various industries yielding capital income. The share of different industries in aggregate capital income of organized manufacturing indicated by the ASI data is used to split the estimate of OS for registered manufacturing and corporate sector reported in the NAS. The methodology applied for unregistered manufacturing and household sector is similar, utilizing published results and unit level data of survey of unorganized manufacturing industries to split (proportionately) the estimate of CE in the NAS for aggregate unregistered manufacturing. The estimated wage payment is subtracted from the estimated value added to obtain an estimate of capital income and mixed income of the self -employed in various unorganized manufacturing industries. The estimate of MI provided in NAS for unregistered manufacturing and household sector has then been proportionately distributed across industries using the estimate of capital income and mixed income of the self-employed in various industries that could be formed on the basis of published results and unit level data of survey of unorganized manufacturing industries. Unlike the ASI data for organized manufacturing, the data for unorganized manufacturing enterprises are available for only select years and interpolation/extrapolation is used to obtain the relevant proportions for other years."

    "output": "The estimation of \\u03b7 has been done with the help of NSS survey-based estimates of employment of different categories of workers (number of persons and days of work) and wage rates (which has been described briefly in chapter 4) coupled with estimates of MI, basically obtained from the NAS. Two approaches have been taken to get an estimate of \\u03b7, and the labour income share series for different industries finally adopted in the study makes use of an average of the estimates of \\u03b7 obtained by the two approaches.\n\nIn the first approach, an estimate of labour income of self-employed workers has been made for each study industry for eight years, 1983-84, 1987-88, 1993-94, 1999-00, 2004-05, 2009-10, 2011-12 and 2015-16 on the basis of the estimated number of self-employed, wage rate of self-employed and the number of days of work per week. The industry-wise estimates of number of self-employed, wage rate of self-employed and the number of days of work per week have been made from unit records of NSS employment -unemployment survey (major rounds) of 1983, 1993 -94, 1999-00, 2004-05, 2011-12, and PLFS of 2018-19, 2019-20 and 2020-21.\n\nThe estimates of the number of self-employed, wage rate of self-employed and the number of days of work per week provide an estimate of the annul labour income of self-employed workers which is divided by the mixed income of self-employed (derived from NAS) to get an estimate of \\u03b7. For five industries, the ratio in question has been computed and applied. For the other 22 industries, the ratio in question has been computed after clubbing the industries into 11 industry groups. In the latter case, a common ratio computed for group of industries has then been applied to constituent industries. The list of industries or industry groups for which \\u03b7 has been estimated is given in table 7.2.\n\nIn the second approach, the NSS data are used to compute the following ratio: the ratio of labour income of self-employed workers to the labour income of regular and casual workers. Let this be denoted by \\u03b8. Then, the estimate of CE provided in the NAS is multiplied by \\u03b8 to obtain an estimate of the labour income component out of the MI reported in the NAS. The labour component of MI divided by total MI gives an estimate of \\u03b7. In case the estimated labour component of MI exceeds the estimate of MI, the estimate of \\u03b7 has been taken as unity.\n\nExamining the estimates obtained by the first approach, it was found that the estimated labour income share out of mixed income varied significantly among the estimates for the seven years for which the ratio in question has been estimated."

    "output": "The estimates of \ud835\udf02 obtained by the second approach has the problem that in a number of cases, the estimated labor component of MI exceeds the estimate of MI given in the NAS, and therefore \ud835\udf02 is taken as one. The method finally adopted is as follows: (a) The average value of \ud835\udf02 has been computed for each industry or industry group by taking the estimates for the years 1983-84, 1987-88, 1993-94, 1999-00, 2004-05, 2009-10, 2011-12 and 2015-16. This has been done separately for the estimates based on approach-1 and those based on approach-2. (b) The estimates of \ud835\udf02 obtained for each industry or industry group by the two approaches have then been averaged. (c) Having obtained an estimate of \ud835\udf02, equation 7.1 has been applied to compute the labour income share. Equation 7.1 is defined as SL it = (CE it +MIit) /GVAit, where SL it is the labour income share in industry i in year t, CE it is compensation of employees in industry i in year t, MIit is mixed income of the self-employed persons in industry i in year t, and GVAit is gross value added in industry i in year t."

    "output": "This chapter deals with the methodology of measurement of total factor productivity (TFP) growth for individual industries in the KLEMS framework and the aggregation from industry level productivity measures to measures for broad sectors and the economy as a whole. The methodology of analysis of sources of gross output growth at the individual industry level and sources of GVA (Gross Value Added) or GDP growth at the broad sector level and economy level will also be presented in this chapter. The measurement of TFP growth for different industries of the Indian economy is based on a gross output production function for each industry j: Y = f(L(L1,\u2026Ln), K(K1\u2026Km), E(E1\u2026.Es), M(M1 \u2026Mu), S(S1 \u2026 Sv ), T) where Y is industry gross output, L is labor input, K is capital input and E, M and S are intermediate inputs-namely energy, material and services and T is an indicator of technology for industry j. All variables are indexed by time (t subscript is suppressed). An important feature of the gross output approach is the explicit role of intermediate inputs, considering energy, material and services. Failure to quantify intermediate inputs leads to missing the role of key industries that produce intermediate inputs and the importance of intermediate inputs for the industries that use them."

    "output": "This document describes the procedures, methodologies and approaches used in the construction of India KLEMS database version 2024. The dataset includes measures of Gross Value Added (GVA), Gross Value of Output (GVO), Labour Employment (L), Labour Quality (LQ), Capital Stock (K), Capital Composition (KQ), the consumptions of Energy (E), Material (M) and Services (S) inputs, Labour Productivity (LP) and Total Factor Productivity (TFP). The database covers 27 industries comprising of the entire Indian economy. The database also provides these estimates at the broad sectoral levels (agriculture, manufacturing and services) and at the all-India levels. The current version of the database covers the period from 1980-81 to 2022-23. The series have been constructed on the basis of data compiled from NSO, NSSO, ASI, Input -Output tables (I- O tables) and processed according to appropriate procedures. These procedures were developed to ensure harmonization of the basic data, and to generate growth accounts in a consistent and uniform way. Harmonization of the basic data has focused on several areas such as industrial classification, and aggregation levels.\nThe production and publication of India KLEMS data base are meant to support empirical research in the area of economic growth and its sources. Most importantly, the database is meant to support the conduct of policies aimed at supporting the acceleration of productivity growth in the Indian economy. The India KLEMS database, in this regard, provides a comprehensive measurement tool to monitor and evaluate productivity growth in the Indian economy. Finally, the construction of the database would also support the systematic production of reliable statistics on growth and productivity using internationally comparable methodologies based on India\u2019s national accounts, input-output tables and labour market surveys.\nThe work relating to compilation of India KLEMS data was being done by the India KLEMS team housed at the Centre for Development Economics, Delhi School of Economics until the end of 2020. The work has been shifted to the KLEMS Division of the Department of Economics and Policy Research of RBI since February 2021The current version of the India KLEMS Database, released hereby, is the third independent compilation of this data by the KLEMS Division in RBI, after the previous release of the data in January 2024."

    "output": "The India KLEMS database covers 27 industries, aggregated into six broad sectors: Agriculture, Hunting, Forestry and Fishing; Mining and Quarrying; Manufacturing; Electricity, Gas and Water supply; Construction; and Services. Measures of Capital (K), Labour (L), Energy (E), Material (M) and Service (S) inputs as well as Gross Output (GO), have been constructed using National Accounts Statistics (NAS), Annual Survey of Industries (ASI), NSSO rounds and Input -Output (IO) Tables. In building annual time series on gross output, five inputs and factor income shares, various assumptions are made to fill up gaps in industry details and link series over time. NSSO rounds of unregistered manufacturing, Input Output Transaction Tables, and Employment and Unemployment Surveys by NSSO are available only for certain benchmark years, necessitating interpolation and assumption of constant shares for building series of output and inputs. However, as the successor of NSSO's Employment Unemployment Survey, the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) data has become available annually since 2017-18, the labour input series no longer requires any extrapolation. The labour input series is being updated under each round of India KLEMS using available survey data from PLFS only. The industrial classification is constructed by building concordance between NIC 2008, NIC 2004, NIC 1998, NIC 1987 and NIC 1970 to generate a uniform definition of \u2018industries\u2019 since 1980-81 and is close to the International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC) revision 3."

The construction of Gross valued added series involves three steps.\n\nStep 1: A concordance table between the classification used in the National Accounts Statistics (NAS) and the 27 study industry classification used for this project has been prepared. Further, concordance between all the 27 sectors has been constructed with NIC - 1970, 1987, 1998, 2004 and 2008. Out of the 27 study industries, for 20 industries, GVA series both in current and constant prices is directly taken from NAS. The sectors for which data are provided in NAS are Agriculture, Forest ry & logging, Fishing, Mining and Quarrying, Manufacturing, Electricity, gas and water supply, Construction, Trade, Hotels & Restaurants, Railways, Transport by other means, Storage, Communication, Banking & insurance, Real estate, Ownership of Dwelling & Business Services, Public Administration & Defense and Other Services.\n\nStep 2: For manufacturing industries where direct estimates of GVA were not available from NAS, estimates have been made using additional information from ASI and NSSO unorganised manufacturing data. In these cases, GVA data is constructed by splitting the NAS data using ASI or NSSO distributions. ASI data (annual) has been used for registered and corporate manufacturing, whereas interpolated ratios from NSSO 40th (1984-85), 45th (1989-90), 51st (1994-95), 56th (2000-01), 62nd (2005-06), 67th round (2010-11) and 73rd round (2015-16) rounds have been used."

    "output": "This chapter describes the procedures and methodologies used in constructing the database for gross output series at the industry level over the period 1980-81(1980) to 2022-2023(2023). To construct the gross output series at industry level, multiple data sources are used, namely National Accounts Statistics, Annual Survey of Industries, NSSO rounds for unorganized manufacturing and Input Output Transaction tables. The NAS is the basic source of data for the construction of time series on the gross output. For years since 2011, the estimates of GVO both at current and constant prices for all industries are taken directly from NAS 2024. For a few industry groups at a more aggregate level, requiring splitting of the aggregates, NAS estimates of output have been split using additional information from the Annual Survey of Industries and NSSO rounds of Unregistered Manufacturing to obtain estimates at a higher level of disaggregation. For Unregistered manufacturing, gross output data is available in NAS from 2004- 05 onwards, and information from NSSO survey rounds has been used for missing years to derive output estimates of unregistered manufacturing industries at current and constant prices. For the gross value-added series of service sectors, estimates are obtained from NAS. However, prior to 2011- 12, National Accounts did not provide any estimates of the gross output of service sectors and hence Input output transaction tables are relied on (from which the ratio of gross to value added is computed which is then applied to GVA reported in NAS) which are available at an interval of 5 years or so. This necessitates interpolation and assumption of constant shares for measuring output of services sectors. The Input Output Transaction Tables for Benchmark years of 1978-79, 1983-84, 1989-90, 1993-94, 1998-99, 2003-04 and 2007-08 are used to derive gross output series for service sectors."

    "output": "This chapter discusses the construction of labour input for 27 industries from 1980-81 to 2022-23. Labour input captures both the quantity of labour ( i.e. number of persons) and quality of labour over time. Labour quality is measured based on educational qualification and wage rates of the workers within each of the 27 industries . Given the limitations of India\u2019s employment statistics (Sivasubramonian; 2004, & Himanshu; 2011, Ghose; 2016), especially the availability of information on wages/ earnings of different category of workers across industries, the database provides only the labour quality index based on five different education categories. Labour input is measured by multiplying the number of persons employed by the index of labour quality which captures the human capital embodied in the labour, constructed separately for each industry. The 38th to 68th rounds of the Employment and Unemployment Survey (EUS) by India\u2019s National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) conducted between 1983 and 2011- 12, respectively, and all the annual Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) rounds from 2017-18 to 2022- 23 by National Statistical Organization (NSO) are the main sou rces data for estimating labour input. We use India\u2019s decadal census and population projections based on Government of India\u2019s various reports for estimating India\u2019s population.  The total employment, measured by the number of persons engaged in each of the 27 industries in India is computed as follows: 1. First, the concordance between 27 KLEMS industries was built with each of NIC-1970, 1987, 1998 and 2008, separately. 2. Based on each round of EUS and PLFS, the distributions of workers by UPSS across the four groups - Rural Male, Rural Female, Urban Male and Urban Fem ale were obtained. These distributions of workers were then multiplied with the all-India figures for the number of workers for each of the years of EUS and PLFS rounds. 3. The all -India figures for the number of workers are generally not directly available from any official sources. We obtain the official estimates of worker-population ratios (WPR) from each of the EUS."

The all -India figures for the number of workers are generally not directly available from any official sources. The official estimates of worker-population ratios (WPR) are obtained from each of the survey rounds and multiply them with India\u2019s total population for the survey year. India\u2019s population for the survey years is obtained by interpolating India\u2019s decadal census populations.\n4. For 2017-18, 2018-19 and 2019-20, the all-India figures for number of employed persons were available from the Government of India (See Table 7 on pg. no 371 of Economic Survey 2021-22, Government of India (https://www.indiabudget.gov.in/budget2022-23/economicsurvey/doc/echapter.pdf).)\n5. For 2020-21 onwards, India\u2019s population growth projections by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare 2020 (See Table 8on pg. 44 on https://main.mohfw.gov.in/sites/default/files/Population%20Projection%20Report%202011-2036%20-%20upload_compressed_0.pdf ) are used. These projections are available for male and female separately, at the all-India level. The growth projection for all-India male (female) population for both urban male (female) and rural male (female) is used.\n6. Finally, L ij is obtained for each industry where i=1 for rural and 2 for urban sectors, and j=1 for male and 2 for female for each round.\n7. Total persons employed in a year were then obtained for each industry as the sum of the Lij over gender and sectors, i.e., \u03a3i\u03a3jLij.\n8. The estimates of employment for the intervening years between each of the EUS and PLFS rounds are obtained by simple interpolation across the four segments- rural male, rural females, urban male and the urban females for all of the 27 industries separately.\n9. The mid-points of the surveys are around the mid-year of the survey rounds, i.e. July for 38th round and 1st Jan for the other rounds; whereas the interpolation has been centered around 1st October which is the mid-year of the national income estimates (This is also the mid-point of financial year.). Hence, the base is shifted to October of each year while interpolating the values (For more detailed discussion on extrapolation and interpolation of the series, readers may refer to KLMES data manual version 2022 released by RBI on its website.). This is done to coincide the survey year mid-point to the mid-point of financial year.\nFor extrapolation backward to 1980- 81 to 1982- 83, the interpolation of the broad industrial classifications of 32nd round (1977-78) and 38thround (1983-84) are used. Thus, the estimates from 32nd round are mainly used as control numbers. Between 2005 and 2011, there was a very high growth rate in number of employed persons series for the industry Electrical and Optical Equipment as compared to other manufacturing industries and the overall growth in employment in this industry during 2005-2011 was found to be higher than that for Construction (which seems somewhat unrealistic). It was also observed that there was a negative growth in employment in Textiles, Textile Products, Leather and Footwear although real GVA of this industry more than doubled between 2005 and 2011. To address these issues, some adjustments to the initial employment estimates for Electrical & Optical Equipment and Textiles, Textile Products, Leather and Footwear have been done. Onwards 2005, employment series for Electrical & Optical Equipment has been estimated applying annual growth rates obtained from ASI and NSSO rounds to the number of employed persons for the year 2005-06. Then, for the years 2005-06 to 2011-12,"

    "output": "To address issues with employment estimates, particularly a high growth rate in the Electrical and Optical Equipment industry between 2005 and 2011 compared to other manufacturing industries and negative growth in Textiles, Textile Products, Leather, and Footwear despite real GVA doubling, adjustments were made. Specifically, the difference between the estimated employment series from EUS rounds and those based on ASI & NSSO rounds for the Electrical and Optical Equipment industry is computed and added to the Textiles, Textile Products, Leather, and Footwear industry. This ensures that, for manufacturing as a whole, the estimates remain the same as obtained from EUS rounds.\n\nThe quality of the labor force is measured using the Jorgenson, Gollop, and Fraumeni (JGF) (1987) methodology.  This involves accounting for changes in labor quality in terms of labor characteristics such as educational attainment, age (experience), gender, and employment status to reflect the heterogeneity of the labor force.  In the India KLEMS study, the index of aggregate labor quality measures changes in the composition of labor in the economy. The present study computes the labor quality index using only education as a characteristic in the JGF methodology. The data required is employment and earnings by education and by industry. The labor quality index is computed using five education categories: up to primary, primary, middle, secondary & higher secondary, and above higher secondary. The quality growth rates are estimated for total persons employed in 27 study industries in India, based on various rounds of the EUS by NSSO and PLFS since 2017-18, and indexed to 1983-84 as the base to assess temporal changes in labor\u2019s skill. Interpolation is done between major rounds for intermediate years, and the series is extrapolated backwards from 1983-84 to 1980-81, with the index recomputed to set 1980-81 equal to 100. The following steps have been performed: 1. Compute the distribution of persons employed by the five educational groups for all the 27 industries for the selected major rounds of EUS and PLFS. 2. Apply these proportions to the number of employed persons in different industries in the major rounds and PLFS to obtain the distribution of persons by education groups. 3. Estimate the earnings data from NSO which relates mainly to the regular and casual persons employed. For employed persons whose wage information is missing, a Mincer equation is used."

    "output": "This chapter outlines the methodology employed to estimate capital Services for the 27 industries in India KLEMS database version 2024. All the productivity calculations in India KLEMS use capital services as an input to production, which is estimated using the approach developed by Jorgenson and Griliches (1967), and outlined in Jorgenson, Gollop, and Fraumeni (1987). The estimation of capital service growth rate is accomplished by first estimating capi tal stock for different assets, and then aggregating them across assets after correcting for the differences in their marginal productivities. Capital services account for the differences in marginal productivity between different asset types while capital stock measures only the vintages of capital, they do not account for asset heterogeneity. For instance, aggregate capital stock measures would assume that a computer's productivity is the same as that of a car. However, proper measures of capital stock would account for the decline in the efficiency of both computers and cars over their lifetime. Following an overview of the theoretical method to measure capital services (Jorgenson and Griliches,1967; JGF, 1987), the chapter discusses the specific empirical approaches we follow to implement these methods within the constraints of data availability for Indian industries. In India KLEMS, we have reported capital stock, capital services and th e capital \u201ccapital composition effect\u201d. Capital stock is reported in constant price volumes, and growth rates, while the latter two are reported in growth rates and indices."

    "input": "Question: How are capital services measured, and what are the key components and calculations involved?",
    "output": "The measurement of capital services involves several components and calculations. First, \\(v_{k,t}\\) is the share of asset k in total capital compensation, calculated as \\(v_{k,t} = \\frac{P_{k,t}^K \\cdot K_{k,t}}{\\sum P_{k,t}^K \\cdot K_{k,t}}\\, where \\(P_{k,t}^K\\) is the rental or user cost of capital asset type k in year t, and \\(K_{k,t}\\) is the capital stock of asset k. This share incorporates the productivity or qualitative differences of various asset types, reflecting that changes in capital composition, such as towards ICT capital, will result in higher capital services.  \\nCapital stock in asset k in year t is constructed using the Perpetual Inventory Method (PIM) as: \\(S_{k,t} = S_{k,t-1}(1 - \\delta_k) + I_{k,t}\\), where \\(S_{k,t}\\) is the capital stock, \\(\\delta_k\\) is the depreciation rate, and \\(I_{k,t}\\) is the real investment in asset type k in period t.  \\nThe capital composition effect (\\(\\Delta \\ln KK_t\\))\u2014the effect of changing asset composition\u2014is calculated as \\(\\Delta \\ln KK_t = \\Delta \\ln K_t - \\Delta \\ln S_t\\), where \\(S_t = \\sum S_{k,t}^k\\). These growth rates are indexed to a base year to obtain a capital composition index \\(KK_t\\), such that \\(KK_t = KK_{t-1} \\times e^{(\\Delta \\ln K_t - \\Delta \\ln S_t)}\\) for t > base year, and \\(KK_t = 100\\) for t = base year."

    "output": "The database on capital services is constructed using multiple sources of information, including the National Accounts Statistics (NAS), the Annual Survey of Industries (ASI), the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) rounds for unorganized manufacturing, and various Input-Output tables. These sources provide information on broad sectors of the economy and detailed asset-by-industry investment matrices. The final estimates are fully consistent with the aggregate data obtained from the NAS. Additionally, the approach to capital measurement aligns with international practices such as the EU KLEMS, facilitating international comparisons. \n\nSpecifically, NAS provides information on aggregate capital formation by industry of use for nine broad sectors. More detailed data on assets and industries are collected from the CSO (Central Statistical Organization). For sectors where investment matrices are unavailable from CSO, information is gathered from other sources like ASI for organized manufacturing and NSSO surveys for unorganized manufacturing, which is then benchmarked to the aggregate investment series from the National Accounts. The data used in the current version of the India KLEMS is based on the revised NAS with a 2011-2012 base and is available since 2012. For earlier years, the series is extrapolated using growth rates from previous versions of the data. Investment data in education and health sectors are obtained directly from national accounts for the period after 2012, while trends in output distribution are assumed to split total investment into sub-sectors for years before 2012."

    "output": "Table 5.1 outlines the capital asset types in National Accounts Statistics (NAS) and their corresponding assets in India KLEMS. For the public sector, NAS asset types include Buildings*, Other construction*, Transport Equipment, Machinery & Equipment, Software (1999-00 onwards), and ICT equipment (2012 onwards).

Also, transport equipment was not separately available for both public and private sectors since 2016, and therefore, we used a fixed proportion of transport equipment to total machinery and equipment from 2016."

    "input": "Question: How is total investment calculated for each asset category, and what adjustments are made for specific sectors and time periods?",
    "output": "Total investment in each asset category is calculated as the sum of private and public-sector investment in each asset. Investment in transport equipment was not available separately for the private sector industries. Therefore, the NAS total machinery in the private sector was distributed using the industry distribution of machinery and transport equipment. These estimates are then subtracted from each industry\u2019s total machinery & transport equipment data to obtain the transport equipment investment in the private sector industries. Using this approach, investment in transport equipment by industries was generated for the period 1950-2016. The share of transport equipment in the total machinery and equipment was assumed to remain unchanged in subsequent years while estimating nominal investment in transport equipment similarly. The nominal investment was deflated using the GFCF deflator for transport equipment. Since the distinction between registered and unregistered manufacturing is not available in the NAS since 2016, a quick fix was used to split these two by considering the household sector as a proxy for unregistered and the corporate and public sector as a proxy for the registered sector.\n\nUpdates for years since 2017-18 are solely based on published aggregate GFCF data from the National Accounts. While extending the past series of detailed asset-wise investments forward for years since 2017-18 using the NAS-published headline series, the published NAS series is considered as the benchmark since 2012. Then the industry distribution of the 2012-2016 detailed series obtained previously from the CSO is applied."

    "input": "Question: How is gross fixed capital formation by asset type derived from ASI data, and how are inconsistencies addressed?",
    "output": "Gross fixed capital formation by asset type is derived from the yearly detailed volumes of the ASI, beginning 1964-65. For the years 1964-1978, the data is obtained from published detailed volumes. For the period 1983-84 to 2004-05, ASI generated detailed tables from Block C of the ASI schedule, containing data on fixed assets. Data for the missing years are interpolated using changes in investment based on the book value method. Though ASI provides investment in land, for reasons of NAS consistency, it is excluded from the database.\n\nOnce investment in each of these assets and industries is generated using ASI data, this industry-asset distribution is applied to the published aggregate NAS GFCF series for the organized manufacturing sector.  From 1960-61 to 1971-72, ASI data is for the census sector, and from 1973-74 onwards, it is for the factory sector. To make these two series comparable, data prior to 1972 is converted to the factory sector using the factory/census ratio in 1973.  This provides investment data for 13 manufacturing sectors, by asset types, consistent with the NAS aggregate for registered manufacturing. This approach was accurate for the period 1950-2016 when the NAS provided aggregate registered manufacturing GFCF data. For the years after 2016, since NAS does not provide registered manufacturing aggregate, registered manufacturing is proxied by the sum of the public sector and corporate sector."

    "input": "Question: How is the gross investment series created for the 13 sectors of the unorganized manufacturing sector, and what data sources and methods are used for investment prices, initial stock, depreciation rates, and rate of return?",
    "output": "The data required for creating the gross investment series for the 13 sectors of the unorganized manufacturing sector are obtained from various rounds of NSSO surveys on unorganized manufacturing. Six rounds of NSSO surveys are used, covering the period 1989-2016. These are the 45th round (1989-90), 51st round (1994-94), 56th round (2000-01), 62nd round (2005-06), 67th round (2010-11), and 73rd round (2015-16). Unit-level data has been aggregated to 13 industries using the appropriate concordance. NSSO provides net addition to owned assets during the reference year within the block of fixed assets, and this is used as a measure of investment. The investment series arrived at for six rounds were interpolated to obtain the annual time series of unorganized gross fixed capital formation by asset type. As in the case of the registered sector, once the investment by asset types across industries are constructed, the asset-industry distribution is applied to the published NAS aggregate GFCF in unregistered manufacturing to obtain NAS consistent GFCF by asset type and industries.\n\nTo compute asset-wise capital stock using PIM (equation 5.3) and rental price (see Box 5.1A in the Appendix), asset-wise investment price deflators are required. Since CSO has provided investment data by industries and assets both in current and constant prices, price deflators with base 2011-2012 could be derived. For years before 2011, prices were spliced using 2004-2005 base investment deflators. These deflators are directly used for all the three asset categories. Since there was no separate asset wise data available for transport equipment in 2017-2018, the investment deflator for transport equipment from 2016-2017 was extrapolated using the trend in the investment price of total machinery & equipment, obtained from NAS.\n\nFor the implementation of PIM to estimate asset wise capital stock, an estimate of initial benchmark stock is required. NAS provides estimates of net capital stock since 1950 for all the broad sectors in its Statement 17: Net Fixed Capital Stock by industry of use. The NAS estimate of real net capital stock in 1950 (in 1999-2000 prices) is taken as the benchmark stock for all non-manufacturing sectors, and for manufacturing sectors the same is taken for the year 1964. However, since the NAS estimate is available only for broad sectors and for aggregate capital, the industry-asset distribution of GFCF is used to create net fixed capital stock estimates by asset type for all the 27 sectors. The approach to split asset-wise capital stock is changed in the 2020 version of the India KLEMS database. Instead of using the GFCF distribution, the distribution of net capital stock is used."

    "input": "Question: How does the India KLEMS database use asset data and depreciation rates to compute capital input, and what source is used for the rate of return?",
    "output": "The 2020 version of the India KLEMS database uses detailed asset data obtained from the CSO to determine the distribution of net capital stock by assets. This replaces the GFCF distribution used previously. While the impact of this change on individual asset levels diminishes over time due to depreciation, it affects the overall composition of assets in the total capital stock, leading to historical revisions in capital stock growth rates in some industries. NAS provides tables on the assumed life of assets, and these estimates of lifetime are used to derive depreciation rates for non-ICT assets, using a double declining balance rate, with buildings assumed to have a lifetime of 80 years, transport equipment 20 years, and machinery and equipment 25 years, as per NAS guidelines (CSO, 2007). Capital input is calculated using equation (5.1), requiring estimates of rental prices. Assuming capital service flow is proportional to capital stock at the individual asset level, aggregate capital flows are obtained using a Translog quantity index, weighting growth in each asset's stock by its average share in the value of capital compensation. The rate of return (i) in equation (5.4) is an external rate of return, proxied by the average return on government securities and the prime lending rate obtained from the Reserve Bank of India. A real rate is used."

    "instruction": "Answer the question based on the provided context from the financial report.",
    "input": "Question: What are some outstanding issues with the measures of capital input available in India KLEMS, and what are some potential solutions or future extensions being considered?",
    "output": "The measures of capital input available in India KLEMS are based on only three asset categories: construction, machinery, and transport equipment. Therefore, it does not consider the enormous and distinct role of ICT capital in contributing to productivity and growth. The absence of ICT estimates in the database is driven by insufficient data on investment in ICT assets, such as hardware, software, and communication equipment in the National Accounts. However, during recent years, NAS has extended its asset coverage to include software and ICT equipment. Erumban and Das (2016) have made some estimates for the aggregate economy using input-output tables for ICT equipment and relying on NAS for software investment. Similarly, Erumban and Das (2020) have made some initial estimates of ICT capital by industries, which still remains a challenging task. Nevertheless, now that more data is available from NAS, it is possible to explore this further, and future extensions of the database may explore this. Similarly, following the SNA 2008 guidelines, the NAS now provides estimates of intangible capital such as intellectual property and research and development (R&D), which may be a useful extension to the capital input database.\nTwo additional challenges are arising since the new system of national accounts. The first is the lack of separate data on registered and unregistered manufacturing, which poses challenges in using ASI and NSSO data to split aggregate manufacturing data into 13 industry groups. Instead of the registered and unregistered split, CSO now provides a division between the household and corporate sectors. This challenge is currently addressed by considering the household sector as unregistered manufacturing and the sum of public and corporate sectors as a registered sector.\nThe second challenge is the lack of separate data on transport equipment and machinery assets in the new series of national accounts, which follows United Nation's System of National Accounts (SNA)-2008. Although, for the time being, an ad-hoc approach is adopted to fix this, it cannot be adopted on a long-term basis, which might necessitate combining transport equipment and machinery to one single asset.\nFinally, the debate on whether it is appropriate to use an external rate of return or an internal rate of return is unsettled in the literature. It may be worth exploring estimates of capital using the internal rate of return. As mentioned in the context, the present version of the database uses an external rate of return, proxied by average of return on government securities and prime lending rate obtained from the Reserve Bank of India. Therefore, a real rate, which is net of capital gain, is used. Hence, the capital gain component in equation is excluded while estimating rental price using external rate of return, obtaining  \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc58,\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc3e = \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc58,\ud835\udc61\u22121\ud835\udc3c \u2219\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc61 + \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc58,\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc3c \u2219\ud835\udeff\ud835\udc58 (5.4) where r is the real rate of return, nominal interest rate adjusted for consumer price inflation rate and the consumer price indices (CPI) are obtained from IMF and World Bank."

The components include the rate of return, depreciation, and capital gain. Therefore, the rental price is determined by the nominal rate of return, economic depreciation costs, and asset-specific capital gains. The rate of return can be measured as internal (ex-post) or external (ex-ante). The India KLEMS database uses an external rate of return, considering prevailing interest rates in the economy, as detailed in section 2.4. While taxes ideally should be included, data limitations preclude this refinement in the database."

    "output": "In Chapter 6, the basic approach used to derive the volume series of Intermediate Inputs, namely Energy input (E), Material input (M), and Services input (S), is described. The methodology for measuring industry output, intermediate inputs, and value added was developed by Jorgenson, Gallop, and Fraumeni (1987) and extended by Jorgenson (1990 a). The cornerstone of this approach is a time series of input-output (IO) tables which gives the flows of all commodities in the economy, as well as payments to primary factors. Following a similar approach as explained in Jorgenson et al. (2005, Chapter 4) and Timmer et al. (2010, Chapter 3), the time series on intermediate inputs for the India KLEMS project have been constructed.\n\nAs in EU KLEMS, this study identifies three main categories of Intermediate inputs:\n1. Energy Input, which includes: Coal and Lignite, Petroleum products, Electricity (with the exception of electricity used in the electricity sector, which is treated as material), Natural gas, and Gas (LPG).\n2. Material Input\n3. Service Input, which includes: Water supply, Railway transport services, Other transport services, Storage and warehousing, Communication, Trade, and Hotels and restaurants."

    "output": "The Intermediate Inputs are classified into three main categories: Energy Input, Material Input, and Service Input. The following five energy types (and products) have been classified as the Energy input: 1. Coal and Lignite 2. Petroleum products 3. Electricity; (for electricity used in the electricity sector, since there is a good amount of inter-firm sale and purchase of electricity, it has been treated as material rather than as energy) 4. Natural gas 5. Gas (LPG). The following fourteen input items have been classified as the Service input: 1. Water supply 2. Railway transport services 3. Other transport services 4. Storage and warehousing 5. Communication 6. Trade 7. Hotels and restaurants 8. Banking 9. Insurance 10. Ownership of dwellings 11. Education and research 12. Medical and health 13. Other services 14. Public administration. All other intermediate inputs barring the above mentioned nineteen inputs are classified as material input.\n\nThe methodology for computation of Intermediate Input Series for 27 Industries from 1980- 2023 at current and constant prices is explained in the following steps: Step 1: Concordance is done between IOTT and study industries. The 60/115/130 IOTT industries are aggregated to form industries, and a concordance table between the classification used in our study and each Input Output Transaction Table has been prepared. Step 2: Obtaining estimates for Material, Energy and Service Inputs for 27 Industries, in benchmark years.  In IOTT, no intermediate input is being used in industry 24 \u2013 \u2018Public Administration\u2019. Consequently, the intermediate input series is being directly estimated for only 26 industries from 1980 to 2023. However, we have used \u2018Net Purchase of Commodities and Services\u2019 of Administrative Department as total intermediate input. And using information about \u2018Government Final Consumption Expenditure\u2019 we distribute the total intermediate input in to material, energy and services input. The values of Energy Inputs used, Material Inputs used, Service Input used and Total Intermediate Inputs are obtained. Thus, for each of the benchmark year, estimates are obtained for Material, Energy and Service Inputs that has been used to produce Gross output in the 27 different India KLEMS Industries."

    "output": "A time series (1980 to 2019) of proportions of Material, Energy and Service Inputs in Total Intermediate Inputs for each of the 27 industries is projected as follows:\n\n*   For the Benchmark years i.e., 1978, 1983, 1989, 1993, 1998, 2003, 2007 and 2015 proportions of Material Inputs, Energy Inputs, and Service Inputs in Total Intermediate Inputs are calculated.\n*   Similar proportion for intervening years is obtained by linear interpolation of the benchmark proportions.\n*   This gives a time series of proportions of Material, Energy and Service Inputs in Total Intermediate Inputs for each year, from 1980 to 2023.\n*   Thus, using IOTT, the intermediate input vector has been projected for 27 study industries from 1980 to 2023.\n\nThere exists some abnormal fluctuation in the proportions of Material Inputs, Energy Inputs, and Service Inputs in Total Intermediate Inputs for benchmark years. In that case, that specific benchmark proportion is dropped and linearly interpolated with the adjacent benchmark proportions to estimate proportion for intervening years. For the industry \u2018Wood & Wood Products\u2019, proportions of Material Inputs, Energy Inputs, and Service Inputs in Total Intermediate Inputs are estimated from SUT 2015-16 instead of Input Output Transaction Table 2015-16.\n\nFor the industry group \u2018Coke, Refined Petroleum and Nuclear Fuel\u2019, proportions of Material Inputs, Energy Inputs, and Service Inputs in Total Intermediate Inputs are estimated from ASI data instead of Input Output Transaction Table because the relevant proportions differed significantly between the input -out tables and ASI, and the latter is believed to be making a more correct assessment of energy inputs used in the Coke and Petroleum product s industry.\n\nThe projection of the intermediate input vector, using IOTT, needs to be consistent with the estimated output from NAS.\n\n*   The Gross Value of Output and the Gross Value Added at current prices calculated from NAS is taken. The difference between GVO and GVA provides us the gap between value added and gross output for each year or in other words this reflects the Total Intermediate inputs from NAS (GVO-GVA).\n*   The intermediate input vector that has been projected using IOTT will not tally with the above estimates of Total Intermediate inputs from NAS. Thus, the projected input vector has been proportionately adjusted to match the gap between value added and gross output."

    "output": "The projection of the intermediate input vector, using IOTT needs to be consistent with the estimated output from NAS. This involves two steps:\n1.  For Benchmark years: Ratio of Total Intermediate inputs from NAS to that from IOTT is adjusted proportionately to the absolute value of Energy Inputs/Material Inputs/Service Inputs obtained from IOTT.\n2.  For Intervening Years: The interpolated proportions of Energy Inputs, Material Inputs and Services Inputs obtained from IOTT, is applied directly to the total intermediate inputs from NAS to get each inputs share.\nThis gives a time series of Material, Energy, and Service Inputs for 27 study Industries from 1980 to 2023 at current prices.\nTo compute the Intermediate Input Series for 27 study Industries from 1980 to 2023 at constant price, the approach followed is to first form the aggregates of materials, energy and services at current price for each study industry from the benchmark Input Output tables and then develop deflators of Materials, Energy and Service Inputs for each of the 27 study Industries separately. Deflators are constructed as follows:\n\u2022 Deflators are obtained for each of the 115 (IOTT 1989 and 1998) and 130 (IOTT 2007) commodity inputs (each row of the IO Matrix).\n\u2022 WPI for the period 1980 to 2023 is taken from Office of the Economic Adviser, Ministry of Commerce and Industry.\n\u2022 Best available Wholesale Price Index is applied to each commodity input in the IOTT.\n\u2022 In several cases, no proper WPI is avail able for the sector; hence the best among the available has been chosen.\n\u2022 In some cases, the right index has been formed from item level indices.\n\u2022 In some case, one index has been removed from a higher -level aggregate to generate the right index.\n\u2022 For Electricity as an input entering into the production process of an industry, depending on the nature of economic activity, the right price of electricity has been chosen. For instance, in the case of manufacturing industries, the price of electricity f or industry considered, similarly for agriculture the price of electricity for agriculture.\n\u2022 For Service Inputs, since WPI is not available hence implicit GDP deflators from NAS are used.\n\u2022 Deflators obtained for different IO sectors have been combined using weights. The weights are based on the column of the relevant study industry in the IO table. This is because; the entries read down industry columns give the commodity inputs of raw -materials"

    "output": "The materials, energy, and services series for each industry at current prices were obtained using Input-Output (IO) tables. Three IOTTs were used: 1989, 1998, and 2007. The price series based on the 1989 table was used from 1980 to 1993, the 1998 table from 1993 to 2003, and the 2007 table from 2003 to 2023. Once the three series were formed, they were spliced. To compute the time series on intermediate input for 27 study industries from 1980-2023 at constant prices, the deflators for Material, Energy, and Service Inputs for each study industry have been used to deflate the Current price Intermediate Input series to Constant price. For the Agriculture sector the deflated value of intermediate input is adjusted to the gap between value added and gross output at constant price, since Gross Value Added for Agriculture estimated by NAS using double deflated method. Thus, a time series of Material, Energy and Service Inputs for 27 study Industries at constant prices is obtained."

    "input": "Question: What is the methodology for measuring labor income share series, and why is understanding income distribution important in growth accounting?",
    "output": "The distribution of income between capital, labor, and intermediate inputs is an important element in growth accounting because income shares, under conditions of competitive markets, can be used to measure the contributions each factor makes towards output growth. Under the assumption of constant returns to scale with two factors of production (labor and capital), the sum of the labor income share and capital income share is 1. The labor income share is defined as the ratio of labor income to GVA, and the capital income share is accordingly obtained as one minus the labor income share. To compute the labor income share out of value added, one has to take the sum of the compensation of employees and that part of the mixed income which are wages for labor. The computation of labor income share for the 27 study industries involves two steps: First, estimates of CE and MI have to be obtained for each of the 27 study industries from the NAS data which are available only for the NAS sectors (see Table 7.1). Second, the estimate of mixed income has to be split into labor income and capital income for each industry for each year (except for those industries for which the reported mixed income is zero, for instance, public administration)."

    "input": "Question: What data sources and procedures are used to compute the labor income share and estimate CE, OS, and MI for the 27 study industries?",
    "output": "The computation of labor income share uses NAS, ASI, and unit level data from surveys of unorganized manufacturing enterprises to obtain estimates of CE, OS, and MI for each of the 27 study industries. Unit level data from the NSS employment-unemployment survey are used along with the estimates of CE, OS, and MI from the NAS to split the labor and non-labor components out of the mixed income of self-employed individuals.\n\nThe estimation of labor income share for the 27 study industries is done in two steps:\n\nStep 1: Estimation of CE, OS, and MI for the 27 study Industries\nNAS provides estimates of compensation of employees (CE), operating surplus (OS) and mixed income (MI) for the 9 NAS industries. For some industries, the required data are readily available from NAS. For others, the estimates available in NAS have to be distributed across the study industries using ASI data. The NAS estimates of factor incomes (CE) for registered manufacturing is split into 13 industries in proportion to the reported ASI data on emoluments for various industries. Estimate of factor incomes for \u2018other services\u2019 in NAS has been split into estimates for (i) Education, (ii) Health and Social Work, and (iii) Other Community, Social and Personal Services including Renting of Machinery and Business Services, and Private Household with Employed Persons.\n\nBefore 2011-12, NAS provides estimates of factor incomes for registered manufacturing and unregistered manufacturing, but not for individual manufacturing industries. However, 2011-12 onwards NAS disaggregated the manufacturing sector in the corporate sector and household sector. The NAS estimates of factor incomes for registered manufacturing and corporate sector have to be split into various manufacturing industries considered in the study (13 in number) using ASI data. The reported CE in NAS for registered manufacturing and corporate sector has been distributed into those 13 industries in proportion to the reported ASI data on emoluments for various industries. In a similar way, using ASI data, the estimate of OS for registered manufacturing and corporate sector has been distributed. Emoluments are subtracted from gross value added for various industries yielding capital income. The share of different industries in aggregate capital income of organized manufacturing indicated by the ASI data is used to split the estimate of OS for registered manufacturing and corporate sector reported in the NAS."

    "input": "Question: What methodology is applied for unregistered manufacturing and household sector, and how are the estimates of wage payments used to split the estimate of CE in the NAS for aggregate unregistered manufacturing?",
    "output": "The methodology applied for unregistered manufacturing and household sector is similar to registered manufacturing. The published results and unit level data of survey of unorganized manufacturing industries have been used for this purpose. The estimates of wage payments (to hired workers) in different industries have been used to split (proportionately) the estimate of CE in the NAS for aggregate unregistered manufacturing. The estimated wage payment is subtracted from the estimated value added to obtain an estimate of capital income and mixed income of the self -employed in various unorganized manufacturing industries. The estimate of MI provided in NAS for unregistered manufacturing and household sector has then been proportionately distributed across industries using the estimate of capital income and mixed income of the self-employed in various industries that could be formed on the basis of published results and unit level data of survey of unorganized manufacturing industries.\n\nUnlike the ASI data for organized manufacturing, the data for unorganized manufacturing enterprises are available for only select years. The proportions mentioned above could therefore be computed only for those select years (data for six rounds have been used; these are for 45th Round (1989-90), 51st Round (1994-95), 56th Round (2000-01), 62nd Round (2005-06), 67th round (2010-11) and 73rd Round (2015-16)). It has accordingly, been necessary to resort to interpolation/ extrapolation to obtain the relevant proportions for other years.\n\nAs explained above, the income share of labour is computed as: SL it = CE it + \u03b7i \u00d7 MIit /GVAit \u2026 (7.1) In this equation, SL it is the labour income share in industry i in year t, CE it is compensation of employees in industry i in year t, MIit is mixed income of the self-employed persons in industry i in year t, and GVAit is gross value added in industry i in year t. The labour income proportion in income is denoted by \u03b7 which taken to be a fixed parameter for each industry, not varying over time.\n\nThe derivation of the GVA series for different industries has been briefly explained in Chapter 2. The derivation of CE and MI series has been explained in step I above. Therefore, only the estimation method of \u03b7 needs to be described. The estimation of \u03b7 has been done with the help of NSS survey-based estimates of employment of different categories of workers (number of persons and days of work) and wage rates (which has been described briefly in chapter 4) coupled with estimates of MI, basically obtained from the NAS. Two approaches have been taken to get an estimate of \u03b7, and the labour income share series for different industries finally adopted in the study makes use of an average of the estimates of \u03b7 obtained by the two approaches."

    "output": "There are two approaches to estimate the labour income proportion in income (\u03b7). In the first approach, an estimate of labour income of self-employed workers has been made for each study industry for eight years, 1983-84, 1987-88, 1993-94, 1999-00, 2004-05, 2009-10, 2011-12 and 2015-16 on the basis of the estimated number of self-employed, wage rate of self-employed and the number of days of work per week derived from unit records of NSS employment-unemployment survey (major rounds) and PLFS. This annual labour income of self-employed workers is divided by the mixed income of self-employed (derived from NAS) to get an estimate of \u03b7. For five industries, the ratio is computed and applied directly. For the other 22 industries, the ratio is computed after clubbing the industries into 11 industry groups, and a common ratio computed for the group is then applied to constituent industries.\n\nIn the second approach, the NSS data are used to compute \u03b8, which is the ratio of labour income of self-employed workers to the labour income of regular and casual workers. Then, the estimate of CE provided in the NAS is multiplied by \u03b8 to obtain an estimate of the labour income component out of the MI reported in the NAS. The labour component of MI divided by total MI gives an estimate of \u03b7. If the estimated labour component of MI exceeds the estimate of MI, the estimate of \u03b7 is taken as unity.\n\nThe average value of \u03b7 is computed for each industry or industry group by taking the estimates for the years 1983-84, 1987-88, 1993-94, 1999-00, 2004-05, 2009-10, 2011-12 and 2015-16.

    "output": "The income share of labor, capital, and intermediate inputs in Gross Output has been computed using the following steps:\n\n\u2022\tFirst, the individual shares of intermediate inputs, that is energy, material, and services in Gross Output, is calculated.\n\u2022\tThe labor income and capital income out of Gross Value Added are further distributed into income share of labor in gross output and income share of capital in gross output.\n\u2022\tThus, we get the share of labor, capital, material, energy, and services in output.\n\u2022\tFor the Agriculture Sector, land is taken as an input. First, the income share of intermediate inputs in gross output is calculated. Then the non-labor income (out of value added) in Agriculture is distributed equally between land and capital inputs to derive weights.\n\n7.3. Outstanding Issues\nThe splitting of unorganized sector factor incomes into individual industries has been done using unorganized survey results. The proportions computed for 1983-84 have been applied for the period 1980-81 to 1983-84. While there were surveys of unorganized manufacturing enterprises in 1978-79, the survey results have not been used for estimation of factor incomes in different industries of the unorganized manufacturing sector."

    "input": "Question: What is the methodology for measuring total factor productivity (TFP) growth for individual industries in the KLEMS framework?",
    "output": "This chapter deals with the methodology of measurement of total factor productivity (TFP) growth for individual industries in the KLEMS framework and the aggregation from industry level productivity measures to measures for broad sectors and the economy as a whole. The methodology of analysis of sources of gross output growth at the individual industry level and sources of GVA (Gross Value Added) or GDP growth at the broad sector level and economy level will also be presented in this chapter. Our measurement of TFP growth for different industries of the Indian economy is based on a gross output production function for each industry j: Y = f(L(L1, \u2026, Ln), K(K1\u2026Km), E(E1\u2026.Es), M(M1 \u2026Mu), S(S1 \u2026 Sv ), T), where Y is industry gross output, L is labour input, K is capital input and E, M and S are intermediate inputs-namely energy, material and services and T is an indicator of technology for industry j. All variables are indexed by time (t subscript is suppressed).\nThere are several things to note about the production function - (1) all variables are aggregates of many components that have been discussed in the earlier report/chapters; (2) we assume that the industry production function is separable in these aggregates; (3) time (indicator of technology) enters the production function symmetrically and directly with inputs. An important feature of the gross output approach is the explicit role of intermediate inputs. In our study, we have considered three intermediate inputs - energy, material and services and this is important as we may find that intermediate inputs are the primary component of some industries outputs. Failure to quantify intermediate inputs leads us to miss both the role of key industries that produce intermediate inputs and the importance of intermediate inputs for the industries that use them. To estimate the contributions of total factor productivity, and inputs to industry level output growth, based on the above-mentioned production function, we construct real values of inputs and output, using industry level price data for capital, labour and intermediate inputs, and output. e.g., PYj; PL j, PK j; PE j. PM j, PS j. The industry price of an input varies across industries."

    "output": "This document describes the procedures, methodologies, and approaches used in the construction of India KLEMS database version 2023. The dataset includes measures of Gross Value Added (GVA), Gross Value of Output (GVO), Labour Employment (L), Labour Quality (LQ), Capital Stock (K), Capital Composition (KQ), the consumptions of Energy (E), Material (M) and Services (S) inputs, Labour Productivity (LP) and Total Factor Productivity (TFP). The database covers 27 industries comprising of the entire Indian economy. The database also provides these estimates at the broad sectoral levels (agriculture, manufacturing and services) and at the all-India levels. In the current version of the database covers the period from 1980-81 to 2021-22. The series have been constructed on the basis of data compiled from NSO, NSSO, ASI, Input-Output tables (I-O tables) and processed according to appropriate procedures. These procedures were developed to ensure harmonization of the basic data, and to generate growth accounts in a consistent and uniform way. Harmonization of the basic data has focused on several areas such as industrial classification, and aggregation levels.\nThe production and publication of India KLEMS database are meant to support empirical research in the area of economic growth and its sources. Most importantly, the database is meant to support the conduct of policies aimed at supporting the acceleration of productivity growth in the Indian economy. The India KLEMS database, in this regard, provides a comprehensive measurement tool to monitor and evaluate productivity growth in the Indian economy. Finally, the construction of the database would also support the systematic production of reliable statistics on growth and productivity using internationally comparable methodologies based on India\u2019s national accounts, input-output tables and labour market surveys. \nThe work relating to compilation of India KLEMS data was being done by the India KLEMS team housed at the Centre for Development Economics, Delhi School of Economics until the end of 2020. The work has been shifted to the KLEMS Division of the Department of Economics and Policy Research of RBI since February 2021. The KLEMS Division at RBI compiled the India KLEMS data under the supervision of the India KLEMS team until 2022. The current version of the India KLEMS Database, released hereby, is the second independent compilation of this data by the KLEMS Division in RBI, after the previous release of the data in 2023."

    "output": "The India KLEMS database covers 27 industries, which are aggregated into six broad sectors: Agriculture, Hunting, Forestry and Fishing; Mining and Quarrying; Manufacturing; Electricity, Gas and Water supply; Construction; and Services. Table 1.1 provides a list of the 27 industries, including the higher aggregates. The industrial classification is constructed to generate a uniform definition of \u2018industries\u2019 since 1980-81 and is very close to the International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC) revision 3. Measures of Capital (K), Labour (L), Energy (E), Material (M) and Service (S) inputs as well as Gross Output (GO), have been constructed using National Accounts Statistics (NAS), Annual Survey of Industries (ASI), NSSO rounds and Input -Output (IO) Tables. In building annual time series on gross output, five inputs and factor income shares, various assumptions are made to fill up gaps in industry details and link series over time. As we know that NSSO rounds of unregistered manufacturing, Input Output Transaction Tables, and Employment and Unemployment Surveys by NSSO are available only for certain benchmark years, the use of information from these data sources necessitates interpolation and assumption of constant shares for building a series of output and inputs. However, as the successor of NSSO's Employment Unemployment Survey, the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) data has become available annually since 2017-18, the labour input series no longer requires any extrapolation. The labour input series is being updated under each round of India KLEMS using available survey data from PLFS only. Finally, the other series like NDP at factor cost, compensation of employees, etc. are additional series which are used in generating the growth accounts and are informative by themselves."

The construction of Gross valued added series involves three steps:\nStep 1: A concordance table between the classification used in the NAS and the 27 study industry classification used for this project has been prepared. Further, concordance between all the 27 sectors has been constructed with NIC - 1970, 1987, 1998, 2004 and 2008. Out of the 27 study industries, for 20 industries, GVA series both in current and constant prices is directly taken from NAS. The sectors for which data are provided in NAS are Agriculture, Forestry & logging, Fishing, Mining and Quarrying, Manufacturing, Electricity, gas and water supply, Construction, Trade, Hotels & Restaurants, Railways, Transport by other means, Storage, Communication, Banking & insurance, Real estate, Ownership of Dwelling & Business Services, Public Administration & Defense and Other Services.\nStep 2: For manufacturing industries where direct estimates of GVA were not available from NAS, estimates have been made using additional information from ASI and NSSO unorganised manufacturing data. In these cases, GVA data is constructed by splitting the NAS data using ASI or NSSO distributions. ASI data (annual) has been used for registered and corporate manufacturing, whereas interpolated ratios from NSSO 40th (1984-85), 45th (1989-90), 51st (1994-95), 56th (2000-01), 62nd (2005-06), 67th round (2010-11) and 73rd round (2015-16) rounds have been used."

    "output": "This chapter describes the procedures and methodologies used in constructing the database for gross output series at the industry level over the period 1980-81(1980) to 2021-2022(2021). To construct the gross output series at industry level, multiple data sources are used namely National Accounts Statistics, Annual Survey of Industries, NSSO rounds for unorganized manufacturing and Input Output Transaction tables. The data sources and methodology used are documented below:\nNational Accounts Statistics: The NAS is the basic source of data for the construction of time series on the gross output. The NAS back series 2011 with base 2004-05 and NAS 2014 provides estimates of gross output for six disaggregate industries at current and constant prices since 1950-51 till 2011-12. These sectors are Agriculture, Mining and Quarrying, Construction and Manufacturing sectors (Registered and Unregistered Manufacturing). However, the Back Series with base 2011-12, which is the source of GVA in India KLEMS database 2022, does not provide estimates of GVO for most of the industries except for Agriculture, Mining and Quarrying and Construction. For these three industries, GVO data at current and constant prices were directly obtained from Back Series with a base 2011-12. Therefore, for the 1980-81 to 2011-12 period, the GVO series for the remaining 24 industries at current and constant prices are estimated by applying the respective GVO/GVA ratio for current and constant prices obtained from Back Series with base 2004-05 and NAS 2014 to GVA with 2011-12 base. For years since 2011, estimates of GVO both at current and constant prices for all industries are taken directly from NAS 2023. (a) Filling procedures of National Accounts series : It is to be noted that the NAS estimates of gross output for a few industry groups are at a more aggregate level, requiring splitting of the aggregates. In such cases, NAS estimates of output have been split using additional information from the Annual Survey of Industries and NSSO rounds of Unregistered Manufacturing to obtain estimates at a higher level of disaggregation. Secondly, for Unregistered manufacturing, gross output data is available in NAS from 2004-05 onwards. In this case, information from NSSO survey rounds has been used for missing years to derive output estimates of unregistered manufacturing industries at current and constant prices. As mentioned earlier, for the gross value-added series of service sectors, estimates are obtained from NAS. However, prior to 2011-12, National Accounts did not provide any estimates of the"

This necessitates interpolation and assumption of constant shares for measuring output of services sectors. The Input Output Transaction Tables for Benchmark years of 1978-79, 1983-84, 1989-90, 1993-94, 1998-99, 2003-04 and 2007-08 are used to derive gross output series for service sectors."

    "output": "This chapter discusses the construction of labour input for 27 industries from 1980-81 to 2021-22. Labour input captures both the quantity of labour ( i.e. number of persons) and quality of labour over time. Labour quality is measured based on educational qualification and wage rates of the workers within each of the 27 industries . Given the limitations of India\u2019s employment statistics (Sivasubramonian; 2004 , & Himanshu; 2011, Ghose; 2016), especially the availability of information on wages/ earnings of different category of workers across industries, the database provides only the labour quality index based on five different education categories. Labour input is measured by multiplying the number of persons employed by the index of labour quality which captures the human capital embodied in the labour, constructed separately for each industry. The 38th to 68th rounds of the Employment and Unemployment Survey (EUS) by India\u2019s National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) conducted between 1983 and 2011 -12, respectively, and the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) rounds of 2017-18, 2018-19, 2019-20, 2020-21 and 2021-22 by National Statistical Organization (NSO) are the main sources data for estimating labour input. Additionally, for estimating India\u2019s population growth rate, India\u2019s decadal census and country-wise population growth rates by the World Bank are used. The total employment, measured by the number of persons engaged in each of the 27 industries in India is computed as follows: 1. First, the concordance between 27 KLEMS industries was built with each of NIC-1970, 1987, 1998 and 2008, separately. 2. Based on each round of EUS and PLFS, the distributions of workers by UPSS 2 across the four components - Rural Male, Rural Female, Urban Male and Urban Female were obtained. These distributions of workers were then multiplied with the all-India figures for the number of workers for each of the years of EUS and PLFS rounds. 3. The all -India figures for the number of workers are generally not directly available from any official sources. The official estimates of worker-population ratios (WPR) are obtained from each of the EUS, and PLFS rounds."

First, the concordance between 27 KLEMS industries was built with each of NIC-1970, 1987, 1998 and 2008, separately.\n2.  Based on each round of EUS and PLFS, the distributions of workers by UPSS across the four components - Rural Male, Rural Female, Urban Male and Urban Female were obtained. These distributions of workers were then multiplied with the all-India figures for the number of workers for each of the years of EUS and PLFS rounds.\n3.  The all-India figures for the number of workers are generally not directly available from any official sources. Worker-population ratios (WPR) are obtained from each of the survey rounds and multiply them with India\u2019s total population for the survey year. India\u2019s population for the survey years is obtained by interpolating India\u2019s decadal census populations.\n4.  For 2017-18, 2018-19 and 2019-20, the all-India figures for number of employed persons were available from the Government of India. These figures were directly used in the estimates.\n5.  For 2020-21 and 2021-22, India\u2019s total population was projected using the annual population growth rates for India provided by the World Bank. The World Bank estimates were scaled up with the same proportion by which India\u2019s population growth rate in 2011-12 based on the latest Census Report exceeded that of World Bank estimates.\n6.  Finally, Lij is obtained for each industry where i=1 for rural and 2 for urban sectors, and j=1 for male and 2 for female for each round.\n7.  Total persons employed in a year were then obtained for each industry as the sum of the Lij over gender and sectors, i.e., \u03a3i\u03a3jLij.\n8.  The estimates of employment for the intervening years between each of the EUS and PLFS rounds are obtained by simple interpolation across the four segments - rural male, rural females, urban male and the urban females for all of the 27 industries separately.\n9.  The mid-points of the surveys are around the mid-year of the survey rounds, i.e. July for 38th round and 1st Jan for the other rounds; whereas the interpolation has been centered around 1st October which is the mid-year of the national income estimates. Hence, the base is shifted to October of each year while interpolating the values. This is done to coincide the survey year mid-point to the mid-point of financial year.\nFor extrapolation backward to 1980-81 to 1982-83, the interpolation of the broad industrial classifications of 32nd round (1977-78) and 38thround (1983-84) are used. Thus, the estimates from 32nd round are mainly used as control numbers. Between 2005 and 2011, very high growth rate in number of employed persons series for the industry Electrical and Optical Equipment was observed as compared to other manufacturing industries and the overall growth in employment in this industry during 2005-2011 was found to be higher than that for Construction (which seems somewhat unrealistic). It was also observed that there was a negative growth in employment in Textiles, Textile Products, Leather and Footwear although real GVA of this industry more than doubled between 2005 and 2011. To address these issues, some adjustments to the initial employment estimates for Electrical & Optical Equipment and Textiles, Textile Products, Leather and Footwear have been done. Onwards 2005, employment series for Electrical & Optical Equipment has been estimated applying annual growth rates obtained from ASI and NSSO rounds to the number of employed persons for the year 2005-06. Then, for the years 2005-06 to 2011-12, we compute the difference between estimated employment series from EUS rounds and that based on ASI & NSSO rounds for the Electrical and Optical Equipment industry and add it to Textiles."

    "input": "Question: How is the labor quality index estimated and why is it important in the context of productivity measurement?",
    "output": "The quality of labor force is of considerable importance in the context of productivity measurement, and one of the widely used methodologies to capture changes in labor quality is given by Jorgenson, Gollop and Fraumeni (JGF) (1987). In growth accounting methodology of measurement of total factor productivity (TFP) when output growth is decomposed into growth of inputs and the residual TFP, then labour input is measured as an index of labour service flows. It accounts for changes in labour quality in terms of labour characteristics such as educational attainment, age (experience), gender, employment status, etc. and thus accounts for heterogeneity of the labour force. In this study, the index of aggregate labour quality measures the changes in the composition of labour in the economy. The present study has computed labor quality index by using only education characteristic in the JGF methodology. Thus, the data required for the labour quality index in the present case, is employment and earnings by education and by industry. The labour quality index has been computed using five education categories namely- up to primary, primary, middle, secondary & higher secondary, and above higher secondary. There are thus five types of persons employed for each of the 27 study industries. The quality growth rates are estimated for total persons employed in these industries in India for the 38 th, 50th, 55th, 61st, 68th rounds of EUS by NSSO, and all the PLFS rounds upto 2021 -22. They are then indexed to 1983 -84 (38th round) as the base, so as to assess the temporal changes in labour\u2019s skill. Interpolation has been done between the major rounds for values of the intermediate years. Since the series is required from 1980 -81, we have extrapolated it backwards from 1983-84 and the index is recomputed with base 1980 -81 equal to 100.  The following steps have been performed: 1. Compute the distribution of persons employed by the five educational groups for all the 27 industries for the selected major rounds of EUS and PLFS. 2. Apply these proportions to the number of employed persons in different industries in the major rounds and PLFS to obtain the distribution of persons by education groups. 3. Estimate the earnings data from NSO which relates mainly to the regular and casual persons employed. It may however be mentioned that even for these two groups, for a large number of persons employed, the wages are either missing or given as zero. For these employed persons whose wage information is missing, a Mincer equation is used to ensure that for the manufacturing as a whole the estimates remain the same as obtained from EUS rounds."

    "output": "This chapter outlines the methodology employed to estimate capital Services for the 27 industries in India KLEMS database version 2023. All the productivity calculations in India KLEMS use capital services as an input to production, which is estimated using the approach developed by Jorgenson and Griliches (1967), and outlined in Jorgenson, Gollop, and Fraumeni (1987). The estimation of capital service growth rate is accomplished by first estimating capital stock for different assets, and then aggregating them across assets after correcting for the differences in their marginal productivities. Capital services account for the differences in marginal productivity between different asset types while capital stock measures only the vintages of capital, they do not account for asset heterogeneity. For instance, aggregate capital stock measures would assume that a computer's productivity is the same as that of a car. However, proper measures of capital stock would account for the decline in the efficiency of both computers and cars over their lifetime. Following an overview of the theoretical method to measure capital services (Jorgenson and Griliches,1967; JGF, 1987), the chapter discusses the specific empirical approaches we follow to implement these methods within the constraints of data availability for Indian industries. In India KLEMS, we have reported capital stock, capital services and the capital \u201ccapital composition effect\u201d. Capital stock is reported in constant price volumes, and growth rates, while the latter two are reported in growth rates and indices."

    "input": "Question: How are capital services measured, and what data and sources are used in the India KLEMS database?",
    "output": "Capital services are measured using asset-wise capital stock (\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc58,\ud835\udc61) and the service price (rental price) of capital assets (\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc58,\ud835\udc61\n\ud835\udc3e ). Assuming a geometric depreciation rate, \ud835\udeff\ud835\udc58, which is constant over time but different for each asset type, capital stock in asset k in year t can be constructed using the Perpetual Inventory Method (PIM) as: \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc58,\ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc58,\ud835\udc61\u22121(1 \u2212 \ud835\udeff\ud835\udc58) + \ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc58,\ud835\udc61, where \ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc58,\ud835\udc61 is the real investment in asset type k in period t. Once estimates of capital stock for each asset are obtained and the growth rates of aggregate capital services are calculated using equation (5.1), the capital composition effect (\u2206 ln \ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc44\ud835\udc61) can be determined as \u2206 ln \ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc44\ud835\udc61 = \u2206 ln \ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc61 \u2212 \u2206 ln \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc61, where \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc61 = \u2211 \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc58,\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc58. These growth rates are then indexed to the base year to obtain a capital composition index(\ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc44\ud835\udc61), i.e., \ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc44\ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc44\ud835\udc61\u22121 \u00d7 e (\u2206 ln \ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc61\u2212\u2206 ln \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc61) for t>base year, and \ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc44\ud835\udc61 = 100 for t=base year. In the India KLEMS database, the capital composition growth rates are indexed to the first year, 1980. The data distinguishes between 3 different asset types: construction, transport equipment, and machinery (includes ICT and non-ICT machinery). Multiple sources, including national accounts statistics, supply-use tables, and industry surveys, are utilized to compile investment data by asset type."

For the Public Sector, Buildings* and Other construction* correspond to Construction; Transport Equipment corresponds to Transport Equipment; Machinery & Equipment corresponds to Machinery & Equipment; Software (1999-00 onwards) and ICT equipment (2012 onwards) correspond to Machinery & Equipment**. For the Private Sector, Residential buildings, Non-residential building, and Other construction correspond to Construction; Machinery & Equipment (incl. transport equipment) corresponds to Machinery & Equipment (transport equipment is excluded later*); Software (1999-00 onwards) and ICT equipment (2012 onwards) correspond to Machinery & Equipment**.

    "output": "Total investment in each asset category is calculated as the sum of private and public-sector investment in each asset. Investment in transport equipment was not available separately for the private sector industries. Therefore, the NAS total machinery in the private sector was distributed using the industry distribution of machinery and transport equipment. These estimates are then subtracted from each industry\u2019s total machinery & transport equipment data to obtain the transport equipment investment in the private sector industries. Using this approach, investment in transport equipment by industries was generated for the period 1950-2016, and the share of transport equipment in the total machinery and equipment was assumed to remain unchanged in subsequent years. The nominal investment was deflated using GFCF deflator for transport equipment. Since the distinction between registered and unregistered manufacturing is not available in the NAS since 2016, the household sector is considered a proxy for unregistered, and the corporate and public sector as a proxy for the registered sector.\n\nUpdates for years since 2017-18 are solely based on published aggregate GFCF data from the National Accounts. In the 2020 version of the data, the published NAS series is now considered the benchmark since 2012, applying the industry distribution of the 2012-2016 detailed series obtained previously from the CSO. This approach ensures a complete consistency with the NAS-published series."

    "output": "To split the aggregate capital formation in the organized manufacturing sector into 13 study sectors, the Annual Survey of Industries (ASI) is used. ASI defines Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) as actual additions (newly purchased, second hand, and own construction) minus deductions plus depreciation adjustment for discarded assets during the year. This approach relies on a single year\u2019s sample, helping to avoid potential huge negative investment series and aligning with published ASI GFCF series.\n\nYearly detailed volumes beginning 1964-65 are used to derive the gross fixed capital formation by asset type directly. Data from published detailed volumes is used for the years 1964-1978, while detailed tables from Block C of the ASI schedule, which contain data on fixed assets, are used for the period 1983-84 to 2004-05. Data for missing years are interpolated using the changes in investment using the book value method. Though ASI provides investment in land, for reasons of NAS consistency it is excluded from the database. Once investment in each of these assets and industries are generated using ASI data, this industry-asset distribution is applied to the published aggregate National Accounts Statistics (NAS) GFCF series for the organized manufacturing sector.\n\nFrom 1960-61 to 1971-72, ASI data are for the census sector, and from 1973-74 onwards, they are for the factory sector. To make these two series comparable over years, the data prior to 1972 is converted to the factory sector."

For unregistered manufacturing, data is sourced from various NSSO surveys spanning 1989-2016. Investment series are interpolated to create annual time series, and asset-industry distribution is applied to the NAS aggregate GFCF in unregistered manufacturing. Investment prices by asset types are computed using price deflators derived from CSO data, with splicing for years before 2011 using 2004-2005 base investment deflators. The investment deflator for transport equipment from 2016-2017 was extrapolated using the trend in the investment price of total machinery & equipment, obtained from NAS for 2017-2018 because there was no separate asset wise data available for transport equipment."

    "output": "The net fixed capital stock is estimated by using the industry-asset distribution of GFCF to create net fixed capital stock estimates by asset type for all 27 sectors. For manufacturing sectors, the same is taken for the year 1964 because the first year of availability of ASI data is 1964-65. In the 2020 version of the India KLEMS database, instead of using the GFCF distribution, the distribution of net capital stock by assets, available from the detailed asset data obtained from the CSO is used. The initial stock depreciates over the years, but the impact of this change in distribution on the capital stock will vanish over the years at the individual asset level. However, as it changes the distribution of assets in the total capital stock, these compositional changes tend to have a visible impact on the aggregate capital stock, causing a historical revision of capital stock growth rates in some industries (esp. transport and storage, education, hotels and restaurants, electricity, transport equipment, etc.).  Following the NAS, an 80-year lifetime is assumed for buildings, 20 years for transport equipment, and 25 years for machinery and equipment (see Appendix 26.2; CSO, 2007). Depreciation rates for non-ICT assets are derived using a double declining balance rate based on these lifetimes. The final depreciation rates used in the study are 2.5% for Building and Construction, 10.0% for Transport Equipment and 8.0% for Machinery."

    "output": "The present version of the database uses an external rate of return, proxied by the average of return on government securities and prime lending rate obtained from the Reserve Bank of India. Therefore, a real rate, which is net of capital gain, is used.

The consumer price indices (CPI) are obtained from IMF and World Bank.\n\nThe measures of capital input available in India KLEMS are based on only three asset categories, construction, machinery, and transport equipment, and does not consider the role of ICT capital. The absence of ICT estimates in the database is driven by insufficient data on investment in ICT assets, such as hardware, software, and communication equipment in the National Accounts. During recent years, NAS has extended its asset coverage to include software and ICT equipment. Erumban and Das (2016) have made some estimates for the aggregate economy using input-output tables for ICT equipment and relying on NAS for software investment. Similarly, Erumban and Das (2020) have made some initial estimates of ICT capital by industries, which still remains a challenging task. Nevertheless, now that more data is available from NAS, it is possible to explore this further, and future extensions of the database may explore this. Similarly, following the SNA 2008 guidelines, the NAS now provides estimates of intangible capital such as intellectual property and research and development (R&D), which may be a useful extension to the capital input database.\n\nTwo additional challenges are arising since the new system of national accounts. The first is the lack of separate data on registered and unregistered manufacturing, which poses challenges in using ASI and NSSO data to split aggregate manufacturing data into 13 industry groups. Instead of the registered and unregistered split, CSO now provides a division between the household and corporate sectors. This challenge is currently addressed by considering the household sector as unregistered manufacturing and the sum of public and corporate sectors as a registered sector. The second challenge is the lack of separate data on transport equipment and machinery assets in the new series of national accounts, which follows United Nation's System of National Accounts (SNA)-2008. Although, for the time being, ad-hoc approaches are adopted to fix this, it cannot be."

    "output": "Several outstanding issues and potential improvements exist for the India KLEMS capital input measures. Currently, the measures are based on only three asset categories: construction, machinery, and transport equipment, which does not consider the distinct role of ICT capital due to insufficient data on investment in ICT assets. While NAS has extended its asset coverage to include software and ICT equipment, further exploration is possible for future extensions of the database. Additionally, following SNA 2008 guidelines, NAS now provides estimates of intangible capital such as intellectual property and R&D, which may be a useful extension. Two additional challenges arise from the new system of national accounts: the lack of separate data on registered and unregistered manufacturing and the lack of separate data on transport equipment and machinery assets. For the latter, combining transport equipment and machinery to a single asset might be necessary in the long term. Finally, the debate on whether to use an external or internal rate of return remains unsettled, making it worthwhile to explore capital estimates using the internal rate of return. The present version of the database uses an external rate of return, proxied by the average of return on government securities and the prime lending rate obtained from the Reserve Bank of India."

    "output": "The rental price of capital reflects the price at which an investor is indifferent between buying and renting the capital good for a one-year lease in the rental market. In the absence of taxation, the rental price equation can be derived as the sum of the nominal rate of return, the nominal cost of depreciation, less capital gain:\n\n\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc58,\ud835\udc61\n\ud835\udc3e = \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc58,\ud835\udc61\u22121\n\ud835\udc3c \u2219 \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61 + \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc58,\ud835\udc61\n\ud835\udc3c \u2219 \ud835\udeff\ud835\udc58 \u2212 (\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc58,\ud835\udc61\n\ud835\udc3c \u2212 \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc58,\ud835\udc61\u22121\n\ud835\udc3c )\n\nwhere \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc58,\ud835\udc61\n\ud835\udc3c  is the investment price (or acquisition price) of asset k in year t, and \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61 is the nominal rate of return. The first component is the rate of return component, which captures the opportunity cost of purchasing a capital asset. The second component is the depreciation component, and the last component, which is the difference between investment prices in year t and t -1, captures the capital gain. Thus, this formula shows that the rental price is determined by the nominal rate of return, economic depreciation costs, and asset-specific capital gains. The rate of return i in the equation can be measured either as an internal or ex-post rate of return \u2013 using the information on realized capital compensation \u2013 or an external or ex-ante rate of return \u2013 such as the prevailing long-term interest rate in the economy. There is continuing debate on which rate is more appropriate for productivity analysis. Empirical evidence suggests that the choice of a particular rate may impact final estimates of capital services and productivity. In India KLEMS, following the arguments that investors make their investment decisions considering the prevailing interest rates in the economy, an external rate of return is used. Ideally, taxes should be included to account for differences in tax treatment of the different asset types and different legal forms (household, corporate, and non-corporate). The capital service price formulas above should then be adjusted to take these tax rates into account. However, this refinement would require data on capital tax allowances and rates by industry and year, which is beyond the scope of this database. Available evidence for major European countries shows that the inclusion of tax rates has only a very minor effect on growth rates of capital services and TFPG."

    "output": "In Box 5.2A, which discusses the backcasting of NAS data methodologies, the process involves extrapolating the 2011-2012 base nominal GFCF series backwards using growth rates from the 2004-2005 series. In previous versions of the KLEMS data, this extrapolation was done by first extrapolating each individual industry in the NAS detailed data and then aggregating them to the KLEMS sector. For example, if a KLEMS sector consists of 'n' NAS industries, the nominal GFCF in the 2012 series was extrapolated for each of these 'n' sectors individually backward using growth rates from the nominal GFCF series from the 2004 version.\n\nHowever, the current 2020 version changes this approach. Now, the extrapolation is done after aggregating the detailed data to the KLEMS sector. This change was implemented because significant inconsistencies were observed in the detailed industry data for some industries between the two versions of the NAS. Therefore, the nominal GFCF is first aggregated for the KLEMS sector and then extrapolated backward for each KLEMS industry.\n\nMore formally, the approach used in KLEMS version 2019 was:\nGFCFj,t2012 = \u2211 GFCFi,t2012n\ni=1 ; for all years since 1950\nwhere GFCFj,t2012 is the nominal GFCF in KLEMS industry j, and GFCFi,t2012 is the GFCF in NAS industry i, both for year t and in 2012 base. The former is obtained as:\nGFCFi,t2012 = [GFCFi,t2004/GFCFi,t+12004] GFCFi,t+12012 for years 1950 -2011, and they are directly obtained from the NAS for years after 2011.\n\nIn the current 2020 version of the KLEMS data, the approach to obtain GFCF for the KLEMS industry j is:\nGFCFj,t2012 = \u2211 GFCFi,t2012n\ni=1 for years 2016-2011, and\nGFCFj,t2012 = [GFCFj,t2004/GFCFj,t+12004] GFCFj,t+12012 for years 1950-2011\nwhere GFCFj,t2004 = \u2211 GFCFi,t2004n\ni=1\n\nThis change in aggregation procedure causes some differences in the historic GFCF growth rate for the KLEMS sector j for the period 1950-2011, leading to a historical revision of capital stock growth rates for the entire series in some industries."

While it may be accurate to use detailed industry data to extrapolate backward (the earlier approach), the magnitude of the fluctuation might affect the quality of the data.

The methodology for measuring industry output, intermediate inputs and value added was developed by Jorgenson, Gallop and Fraumeni (1987) and extended by Jorgenson (1990 a). The cornerstone of this approach is a time series of input output (IO) tables which gives the flows of all commodities in the economy, as well as payments to primary factors. Following a similar approach as explained in Jorgenson et al. (2005, Chapter 4) and Timmer et al. (2010, Chapter 3), the time series on intermediate inputs for the India KLEMS project have been constructed. This study identifies three main categories of Intermediate inputs which are Energy Input, Material Input, and Service Input. The following five energy types (and products) have been classified as the Energy input: Coal and Lignite, Petroleum products, Electricity (for electricity used in the electricity sector, since there is a good amount of inter-firm sale and purchase of electricity, it has been treated as material rather than as energy), Natural gas, and Gas (LPG). The following fourteen input items have been classified as the Service input: Water supply, Railway transport services, Other transport services, Storage and warehousing, Communication, Trade, and Hotels and restaurants."

    "output": "A time series (1980 to 2019) of proportions of Material, Energy and Service Inputs in Total Intermediate Inputs for each of the 27 industries is projected as follows:\n\n*   For the Benchmark years i.e., 1978, 1983, 1989, 1993, 1998, 2003, 2007 and 2015 proportions of Material Inputs, Energy Inputs, and Service Inputs in Total Intermediate Inputs are calculated.\n*   Similar proportion for intervening years is obtained by linear interpolation of the benchmark proportions.\n*   This gives a time series of proportions of Material, Energy and Service Inputs in Total Intermediate Inputs for each year, from 1980 to 2022.\n*   Thus, using IOTT, the intermediate input vector has been projected for 27 study industries from 1980 to 2022.\n\nThere exists some abnormal fluctuation in the proportions of Material Inputs, Energy Inputs, and Service Inputs in Total Intermediate Inputs for benchmark years. In that case, that specific benchmark proportion is dropped and linearly interpolate of the adjacent benchmark proportions to estimate proportion for intervening years. For the industry \u2018Wood & Wood Products\u2019, proportions of Material Inputs, Energy Inputs, and Service Inputs in Total Intermediate Inputs are estimated from SUT 2015-16 instead of Input Output Transaction Table 2015-16.\n\nFor the industry group \u2018Coke, Refined Petroleum and Nuclear Fuel\u2019, proportions of Material Inputs, Energy Inputs, and Service Inputs in Total Intermediate Inputs from ASI data instead of Input Output Transaction Table are estimated. This has been done because the relevant proportions differed significantly between the input -out tables and ASI, and the latter is believed to be making a more correct assessment of energy inputs used in the Coke and Petroleum products industry."

    "output": "The time series of Material, Energy, and Service Inputs for 27 study Industries from 1980 to 2022 are computed at current prices using Steps 1-4. Step 3 involves projecting a time series (1980 to 2019) of proportions of Material, Energy and Service Inputs in Total Intermediate Inputs for each of the 27 industries. The methodology for computation of Intermediate Input Series for 27 study Industries from 1980 to 2022 at constant price is explained in Steps 5 and 6. The approach followed is to first form the aggregates of materials, energy and services at current price for each study industry from the benchmark Input Output tables and then develop deflators of Materials, Energy and Service Inputs for each of the 27 study Industries separately. Step 4 ensures consistency with NAS by adjusting the intermediate input vector, projected using IOTT in Step 3, to match the gap between value added and gross output obtained from NAS. This involves two steps: 1. For Benchmark years: Ratio of Total Intermediate inputs from NAS to that from IOTT is adjusted proportionately to the absolute value of Energy Inputs/Material Inputs/Service Inputs obtained from IOTT. 2. For Intervening Years: The interpolated proportions of Energy Inputs, Material Inputs and Services Inputs obtained from IOTT, is applied directly to the total intermediate inputs from NAS to get each inputs share.  Step 5 focuses on constructing Deflators of Materials, Energy and Service Inputs for 27 study Industries separately, where deflators are obtained for each of the 115 (IOTT 1989 and 1998) and 130 (IOTT 2007) commodity inputs (each row of the IO Matrix). WPI for the period 1980 to 2022 is taken from Office of the Economic Adviser, Ministry of Commerce and Industry. The best available Wholesale Price Index is applied to each commodity input in the IOTT. In several cases, where no proper WPI is available for the sector, the best among the available has been chosen. In some cases, the right index has been formed from item level indices, or one index has been removed from a higher -level aggregate to generate the right index. For Electricity as an input entering into the production process of an industry, depending on the nature of economic activity, the right price of electricity has been chosen. For natural gas from 2004 to 2022 the price information is taken from Indian Petroleum and Natural Gas Statistics. The detailed method of price index construction for Natural gas for the period can be referred from KLEMS data manual 2021.for 2002-03, the end point of the range is taken. For 2003-04, the price has been fixed on"

    "input": "Question: How are deflators constructed for service inputs, and how are time series on intermediate input computed at constant prices?",
    "output": "For Service Inputs, since WPI is not available hence implicit GDP deflators from NAS are used. Deflators obtained for different IO sectors have been combined using weights based on the column of the relevant study industry in the IO table, allowing for changing weights over time using three IOTTs (1989, 1998, and 2007) for different time periods, with splicing performed after the series are formed. The IO tables have been used for obtaining the materials, energy and services series for each industry at current prices. The deflators for Material, Energy and Service Inputs for each study industry have been used to deflate the Current price Intermediate Input series to Constant price. Gross Value Added for Agriculture estimated by NAS using double deflated method. Therefore, for the Agriculture sector the deflated value of intermediate input is adjusted to the gap between value added and gross output at constant price. This results in a time series of Material, Energy and Service Inputs for 27 study Industries at constant prices."

    "input": "Question: What is the methodology for measuring labor income share series at the industry level, and why is it important in growth accounting?",
    "output": "The distribution of income between capital, labor, and intermediate inputs is an important element in growth accounting because income shares, under conditions of competitive markets, can be used to measure the contributions each factor makes towards output growth. Under the assumption of constant returns to scale with two factors of production (labor and capital), the sum of the labor income share and capital income share is 1. The labor income share is defined as the ratio of labor income to GVA, and capital income share is accordingly obtained as one minus labor income share.  The computation of labor income share for the 27 study industries involves two steps: estimates of compensation of employees (CE) and mixed income (MI) have to be obtained for each of the 27 study industries from the NAS data (National Accounts Statistics) which are available only for the NAS sectors. Second, the estimate of mixed income has to be split into labor income and capital income for each industry for each year (except for those industries for which the reported mixed income is zero, for instance, public administration)."

    "input": "Question: What data sources are used for computing labour income share, and how is the estimation of labour income share done for the 27 study industries?",
    "output": "The data sources used for the computation of labour income share are NAS (National Accounts Statistics), ASI (Annual Survey of Industries) and unit level data of survey of unorganized manufacturing enterprises. These data sources are used to obtain estimates of CE (compensation of employees), OS (operating surplus) and MI (mixed income) for each of the 27 study industries. For splitting the labour and non-labour components out of the mixed income of self -employed, the unit level data of NSS employment-unemployment survey are used along with the estimates of CE, OS and MI basically obtained from the NAS. The estimation of labour income share for the 27 study industries has been done in two steps. First, estimates of CE, OS and MI are obtained for the 27 study Industries. NAS provides estimates of compensation of employees (CE), operating surplus (OS) and mixed income (MI) for the 9 NAS industries in different annual Sequence of National Accounts reports. For some industries under study, for instance (i) Agriculture, forestry &  logging and fishing, (ii) Mining & Quarrying, (iii) Electricity, gas and water supply and (iv) Construction, the required data are readily available from NAS. For others, the estimates available in NAS have to be distributed across the study industries using ASI data. The NAS estimates of factor incomes (CE) for registered manufacturing is split into KLMES 13 industries (3-15) in proportion to the reported ASI data on emoluments for various industries. Estimate of factor incomes for \u2018other services\u2019 in NAS has been split into estimates for (i) Education, (ii) Health and Social Work, and (iii) Other Community, Social and Personal Services including Renting of Machinery and Business Services, and Private Household with Employed Persons. Before 2011 -12, NAS provides estimates of factor incomes for registered manufacturing and unregistered manufacturing, but not for individual manufacturing industries. However, 2011 -12 onwards NAS disaggregated the manufacturing sector in corporate sector and household sector. The NAS estimates of factor incomes for registered manufacturing and corporate sector have to be split into various manufacturing industries considered in the study (13 in number) using ASI data. The reported CE in NAS for registered manufacturing and corporate sector has been distributed into those 13 industries in proportion to the reported ASI data on emoluments for various industries."

    "output": "Using ASI data, the estimate of Operating Surplus (OS) for registered manufacturing and corporate sector is distributed by subtracting emoluments from gross value added for various industries, yielding capital income. The share of different industries in aggregate capital income of organized manufacturing indicated by the ASI data is used to split the estimate of OS for registered manufacturing and corporate sector reported in the NAS.\n\nThe methodology applied for unregistered manufacturing and household sector is similar. The published results and unit level data of survey of unorganized manufacturing industries have been used for this purpose. The estimates of wage payments (to hired workers) in different industries have been used to split (proportionately) the estimate of CE in the NAS for aggregate unregistered manufacturing. The estimated wage payment is subtracted from the estimated value added to obtain an estimate of capital income and mixed income of the self -employed in various unorganized manufacturing industries. The estimate of MI provided in NAS for unregistered manufacturing and household sector has then been proportionately distributed across industries using the estimate of capital income and mixed income of the self-employed in various industries that could be formed on the basis of published results and unit level data of survey of unorganized manufacturing industries.\n\nUnlike the ASI data for organized manufacturing, the data for unorganized manufacturing enterprises are available for only select years. The proportions mentioned above could therefore be computed only for those select years (data for six rounds have been used; these are for 45th Round (1989-90), 51st Round (1994-95), 56th Round (2000-01), 62nd Round (2005-06), 67th round (2010-11) and 73rd Round (2015-16)). It has accordingly, been necessary to resort to interpolation/ extrapolation to obtain the relevant proportions for other years."

    "output": "The estimation of \\u03b7 has been done with the help of NSS survey-based estimates of employment of different categories of workers (number of persons and days of work) and wage rates (which has been described briefly in chapter 4) coupled with estimates of MI, basically obtained from the NAS. Two approaches have been taken to get an estimate of \\u03b7, and the labour income share series for different industries finally adopted in  the study makes use of an average of the estimates of  \\u03b7 obtained by the two approaches.\nIn the first approach, an estimate of labour  income of self-employed workers has been made for each study industry for eight years, 1983-84, 1987-88, 1993-94, 1999-00, 2004-05, 2009-10, 2011-12 and 2015-16 on the basis of the estimated number of self-employed, wage rate of self-employed and the number of days of work per week. The industry -wise estimates of number of self -employed, wage rate of self-employed and the number of days of work per week have been made from unit records of NSS employment -unemployment survey (major rounds) of 1983, 1993 -94, 1999-00, 2004-05, 2011-12, and PLFS of 2018-19, 2019-20, 2020-21 and 2021-22.\nThe estimates of the number of self-employed, wage rate of self-employed and the number of days of work per week provide an estimate of the annul labour income of self-employed workers which is divided by the mixed income of self-employed (derived from NAS) to get an estimate of \\u03b7. For five industries, the ratio in question has been computed and applied.  For the other 22 industries, the ratio in question has been computed after clubbing the industries into 11 industry groups. In the latter case, a common ratio computed for group of industries has then been applied to constituent industries. The list of industries or industry groups for which \\u03b7 has been estimated is given in table 7.2.  \nIn the second approach, the NSS data are used to compute the following ratio: the ratio of labour income of self-employed workers to the labour income of regular and casual workers. Let this be denoted by \\u03b8. Then, the estimate of CE provided in the NAS is multiplied by \\u03b8 to obtain an estimate of the labour income component out of the MI reported in the NAS. The labour component of MI divided by total MI gives an estimate of \\u03b7. In case the estimated labour component of MI exceeds the estimate of MI, the estimate of \\u03b7 has been taken as unity.  \nExamining the estimates obtained by the first approach, it was found that the estimated labour  income share out of mixed income varied significantly among the estimates for the seven years for which the ratio in question has been estimated."

    "output": "The method adopted to compute the labor income share involves the following steps: (a) The average value of \uf068 (the ratio of labour income of self-employed workers to the labour income of regular and casual workers) has been computed for each industry or industry group by taking the estimates for the years 1983-84, 1987-88, 1993-94, 1999-00, 2004-05, 2009-10, 2011-12 and 2015-16. This has been done separately for the estimates based on approach-1 (estimate of labour  income of self-employed workers has been made for each study industry for eight years on the basis of the estimated number of self-employed, wage rate of self-employed and the number of days of work per week) and those based on approach-2 (the estimate of CE provided in the NAS is multiplied by \uf068 to obtain an estimate of the labour income component out of the MI reported in the NAS). (b) The estimates of \uf068 obtained for each industry or industry group by the two approaches have then been averaged. (c) Having obtained an estimate of \uf068, equation 7.1 (SL it = (CE it + MIit * \uf068) / GVAit) has been applied to compute the labour income share. It addresses the problem in the second approach where, in a number of cases, the estimated labour component of MI exceeds the estimate of MI given in the NAS, and therefore \uf068 is taken as one."

    "output": "This chapter deals with the methodology of measurement of total factor productivity (TFP) growth for individual industries in the KLEMS framework and the aggregation from industry level productivity measures to measures for broad sectors and the economy as a whole. The methodology of analysis of sources of gross output growth at the individual industry level and sources of GVA (Gross Value Added) or GDP growth at the broad sector level and economy level will also be presented in this chapter. Our measurement of TFP growth for different industries of the Indian economy is based on a gross output production function for each industry j: Y = f(L(L1,\u2026Ln), K(K1\u2026Km), E(E1\u2026.Es), M(M1 \u2026Mu), S(S1 \u2026 Sv ), T). Y is industry gross output, L is labour input, K is capital input and E, M and S are intermediate inputs-namely energy, material and services and T is an indicator of technology for industry j. All variables are indexed by time (t subscript is suppressed). There are several things to note about the production function - (1) all variables are aggregates of many components that have been discussed in the earlier report/chapters; (2) we assume that the industry production function is separable in these aggregates; (3) time (indicator of technology) enters the production function symmetrically and directly with inputs. An important feature of the gross output approach is the explicit role of intermediate inputs. In our study, we have considered three intermediate inputs - energy, material and services and this is important as we may find that intermediate inputs are the primary component of some industries outputs. Failure to quantify intermediate inputs leads us to miss both the role of key industries that produce intermediate inputs and the importance of intermediate inputs for the industries that use them."

    "output": "This document describes the procedures, methodologies, and approaches used in constructing the India KLEMS database version 2021. Till now, the work relating to compilation of India KLEMS data was being done by the India KLEMS team housed at the Centre for Development Economics, Delhi School of Economics. Now the work has been shifted to the KLEMS Division of Department of Economics and Policy Research of RBI since February 2021 and hence the KLEMS data have been compiled independently by the KLEMS Division under the supervision of India KLEMS team. This work is meant to support empirical research in the area of economic growth. In addition, the database is meant to support the conduct of policies aimed at supporting acceleration of productivity growth in the Indian economy, requiring comprehensive measurement tools to monitor and evaluate progress. Finally, the construction of the database would also support the systematic production of reliable statistics on growth and productivity using the methodologies of national accounts and input-output analysis.\n\nFollowing the earlier trend, this version of the database includes measures of economic growth, employment creation, capital formation, and productivity at the industry level from 1980-81 onwards. The input measures will incorporate various categories of Capital (K), Labour (L), Energy (E), Materials (M), and Services (S) inputs. The present document describes the India KLEMS database version 2021. In fact, the present version is an extended India KLEMS research project, \u201cDisaggregate Industry Level Productivity Analysis for India - the KLEMS Approach\u201d undertaken at the Centre for Development Economics, Delhi School of Economics.\n\nThe dataset includes measures of Gross Value Added (GVA), Gross Value of Output (GVO), Labour (L), Capital (K), Energy (E), Material (M), Services (S), Labour Quality (LQ), Labour Productivity (LP) and Total Factor Productivity (TFP) at the industry and economy level from 1980-81 onwards. The database covering the period 1980-81 to 2019-20 has been constructed on the basis of data compiled from NSO, NSSO, ASI, Input -Output tables (I -O tables) and processed according to appropriate procedures. These procedures were developed to ensure harmonization of the basic data, and to generate growth accounts in a consistent and uniform way. Harmonization of the basic data has focused on several areas such as industrial classification, and aggregation levels. The database covers 27 industries comprising the entire Indian economy. The industries are shown in Table 1.1. The variables in the data set are given in Table 1.2. In principle, the 39-year period from 1980-81 (1980) to 2019-20 (2019) is covered in terms of industries and variables."

    "output": "The India KLEMS database version 2021 covers a 39-year period from 1980-81 to 2019-20. At a disaggregated level, the database is created for 27 industries. The industrial classification is constructed by building concordance between NIC 2008, NIC 2004, NIC 1998, NIC 1987, and NIC 1970 to generate continuous time series from 1980 to 2019. This classification is very close to the International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC) revision 3. The 27 industries are aggregated to form six broad sectors: Agriculture, Hunting, Forestry and Fishing; Mining and Quarrying; Manufacturing; Electricity, Gas and Water supply; Construction; and Services.\n\nMeasures of Capital (K), Labour (L), Energy (E), Material (M) and Service (S) inputs, as well as Gross Output (GO), have been constructed using National Accounts Statistics (NAS), Annual Survey of Industries (ASI), NSSO rounds and Input -Output (IO) Tables. In building annual time series on gross output, five inputs and factor income shares, various assumptions are made to fill up gaps in industry details and link series over time. The use of information from these data sources necessitates interpolation and assumption of constant shares for building series of output and inputs. Further the construction of growth accounting series like total factor productivity, labour productivity, etc. are based on theoretical models of production and needs additional assumptions that are spelt out in subsequent chapters of the manual. Finally, the other Series like NDP at factor cost, compensation of employees, etc. are additional series which are used in generating the growth accounts and are informative by themselves."

    "output": "This chapter describes the data sources and methodology used to construct the Gross Value Added (GVA) series at current and constant prices for 27 study industries for the period of 1980-81 (1980) to 2019-20 (2019).\n\nThe National Accounts Statistics (NAS) brought out by the NSO (National Statistics Office, Government of India) is the basic source of data for the construction of series on gross value added for INDIA KLEMS-industries. Up to 2011-12, estimates of GVA at both current and constant (2011-12) prices for all industries are obtained from Back Series of National Accounts (Base 2011-12). For years after 2011-12, they are directly obtained from NAS 2022. However, NAS estimates of value added are not available for a few India KLEMS industry groups. Therefore, we had to split some of the aggregate industry groups from NAS. Maintaining consistency with NAS, the value-added data in India KLEMS is measured at basic price.\n\nThe construction of Gross valued added series involves three steps:\n\nStep 1: A concordance table between the classification used in the NAS and the 27 study industry classification used for this project has been prepared. Further, concordance between all the 27 sectors has been constructed with NIC - 1970, 1987, 1998, 2004 and 2008. Out of the 27 study industries, for 20 industries, GVA series both in current and constant prices is directly taken from NAS. The sectors for which data are provided in NAS are Agriculture, Forestry & logging, Fishing, Mining and Quarrying, Manufacturing, Electricity, gas and water supply, Construction, Trade, Hotels & Restaurants, Railways, Transport by other means, Storage, Communication, Banking & insurance, Real estate, Ownership of Dwelling & Business Services, Public Administration & Defense and Other Services.\n\nStep 2: For manufacturing industries where direct estimates of GVA were not available from NAS, estimates have been made using additional information from ASI and NSSO unorganized manufacturing data. In these cases, GVA data is constructed by splitting the NAS data using ASI or NSSO distributions. ASI data (annual) has been used for registered and corporate manufacturing whereas interpolated ratios from NSSO 40th (1984-85), 45th (1989-90), 51st (1994-95), 56th (2000-01) 62nd (2005-06), 67th round (2010-11) and 73rd round (2015-16) rounds have been used for manufacturing."

    "output": "For unregistered manufacturing, the ratio obtained from the 73rd round of unregistered manufacturing has been used for splitting from 2015-16 to 2019-20. Table 2.1 showcases the methodology used to split GVA of certain NAS sectors to match concordance with our classification.  Specifically, from 1980 to 2011 Gross Value Added of NAS sector (20+361) is split using ASI and NSSO distributions for Wood and products of Wood (20). For Coke, Refined Petroleum and Nuclear Fuel (23), Rubber, Petroleum Products (23+25), ASI and NSSO proportions are used to split GVA of NAS sector (23+25) into separate 23 and 25. Since 2011-12 NAS provides separate series for 23 and 25. For Rubber and Plastic Products (25), which fall under Rubber, Petroleum Products (23+25), the same methodology as above is applied. For Basic Metals and Fabricated Metal Products (27+28) under Basic Metals (271+272+2731+2732) and Metal Products and Machinery (28+29+30), ASI and NSSO proportions are used to split 28, 29 and 30. Add fraction of 28 to Basic metals (27) obtained from NAS. For Machinery, nec. (29) under Metal Products and Machinery (28+29+30), ASI data is used to split GVA of NAS sector Metal products and machinery (28+29+30) to separate 29 from 28+29+30. For Electrical and Optical Equipment (30 to 33) under Electrical Machinery (31+32), GVA of NAS sector Metal Products and machinery (28+29+30) is split using ASI proportions. Add fraction of 30 to Electrical machinery (31+32) obtained from NAS.

    "output": "Chapter 3 describes the procedures and methodologies used in constructing the database for gross output series at the industry level over the period 1980-81(1980) to 2019-20(2019). To construct the gross output series at industry level, multiple data sources are used, namely National Accounts Statistics, Annual Survey of Industries, NSSO rounds for unorganized manufacturing and Input Output Transaction tables. The data sources and methodology used are documented in National Accounts Statistics. The NAS is the basic source of data for the construction of time series on the gross output. The NAS back series 2011 with base 2004 -05 and NAS 2014 provides estimates of gross output for six disaggregate industries at current and constant prices since 1950-51 till 2011-12. These sectors are Agriculture, Mining and Quarrying, Construction and Manufacturing sectors (Registered and Unregistered Manufacturing). However, the Back Series with base 2011 -12, which is the source of GVA in India KLEMS database 2021, does not provide estimates of GVO for most of the industries except for Agriculture, Mining and Quarrying and Construction. For these three industries GVO data at current and constant prices directly obtained from Back Series with base 2011-12. Therefore, for 1980-81 to 2011-12 period, the GVO series for remaining 24 industries at current and constant prices is estimated by applying the respective GVO/GVA ratio for current and constant prices obtained from Back Series with base 2004 -05 and NAS 2014 to GVA with 2011-12 base. For years since 2011, the estimates of GVO both at current and constant prices for all industries are taken directly from NAS 2022. NAS estimates of gross output for a few industry groups are at a more aggregate level, requiring splitting of the aggregates.  In such cases, NAS estimates of output have been split using additional information from Annual Survey of Industries and NSSO rounds of Unregistered Manufacturing to obtain estimates at higher level of disaggregation. Secondly, for Unregistered manufacturing gross output data is available in NAS from 2004 -05 onwards. In this case,  information from NSSO survey rounds has been used for missing years to derive output estimates of unregistered manufacturing industries at current and constant prices. As mentioned earlier, for gross value-added series of service sectors estimates are obtained from NAS. However, prior to 2011-12 National Accounts do not provide any estimates of gross output."

    "output": "Chapter 4 provides information on the sources of data and method of measuring labour services. The aim is to estimate labour input so that it reflects the actual changes in the quantity (number of persons) and quality of labour input over time. The section discusses the construction of labour input for 27 industries from 1980 to 2019 -20. Labour input is measured by combining data on labour persons and data on labour quality which is measured in terms of human capital embodied in the labour. In this study, this is measured on the basis of the educational qualification of the worker. It is important to segregate labor employed from labor quality because the contribution to output by each person also comes from this embodied capital. Moreover, the reward (wages and earnings) to each person also includes the reward for investment in human capital. Therefore, it is essential to separate out these differences in labour to clearly understand the underlying differences in labour characteristics. It is in this context that an endeavor has been made to estimate labour quality index. However, given the limitations of India\u2019s employment statistics (Sivasubramonian; 2004, & Himanshu; 2011, Ghose; 2016), especially the availability of information on wages/ earnings of different category of workers which could be used as an indication of their differences in ability makes it difficult to quantify these changes in the labour force in a pertinent way. Therefore, the study has computed the labour quality index based on five different education categories only. This study aims to build a time series of employment and labor quality series for 27 industrial sectors. In this section we outline the sources of data and the methodology used. The section develops and implements the methodology of estimating persons employed (employment) and labour quality and combining the two to obtain the indices of labour input. The Employment and Unemployment Surveys (EUS) of major rounds from 38th round (1983) to 68th round (2011-12) by National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) and the Periodic Labour Force Surveys (PLFS) of 2017-18, 2018-19 and 2019-20 by National Statistical Organization (NSO) are the main sources for estimating the total workforce in the country by industry groups, as per the National Industrial Classification (NIC).

    "output": "The employment in India has been computed in a step-wise manner as follows:\n\nAs a first step concordance between the KLEMS 27 sectors, and NIC-1970, 1987, 1998 and 2008 was done. Thereafter, the following steps were done:\n\n1.  KLEMS Industry wise distribution of workers by UPSS across the four components - Rural Male, Rural Female, Urban Male and Urban Female were obtained from PLFS 2019-20. These numbers were then adjusted to the employment numbers given in the Economic Survey 2021-22 to find out the number of persons employed in the four segments and the total employment.\n2.  The 27 -industry distribution of Employment from EUS is applied to the number of persons employed in step I to obtain Lij for each industry where i=1 for rural and 2 for urban sectors, and j=1 for male and 2 for female for each round\n3.  The estimates of employment for the intervening years between the major EUS rounds and PLFS 2019-20 have been obtained by simple interpolation across the four segments - rural male, rural females, urban male and the urban females. After ignoring the outliers , the two closest rounds have then been used for interpolation. Further, the mid-point of the survey is around the mid-year of the survey rounds, i.e July for 38th round and 1st  Jan for the other rounds; whereas the interpolation has been centered around 1st October which is the mid -year of the national income estimates. Hence, the base is shifted to October of each year while interpolating the values. This is done to coincide the survey year mid-point to the mid-point of financial year.\n4.  Total persons in a year were then obtained for each industry as the sum of the Lij over gender and sectors, i.e., \u03a3i\u03a3jLij .\nFor extrapolation backward to 1980 -81 to 1982 -83, the interpolation of  the broad industrial classification of 32nd round (1977-78) and 38thround (1983-84) is used. Thus, the estimates from 32nd round are mainly used as control numbers. Between 2005 and 2011, we observed very high growth rate in number of employed persons series for the industry Electrical and Optical Equipment as compared to other manufacturing industries and the overall growth in employment in this industry during 2005 -2011 was found to be higher than that for Construction (which seems somewhat unrealistic). It was also observed that there was a negative growth in employment in Textiles, Textile Products, Leather and Footwear although real GVA of this industry more than doubled between 2005 and 2011. To address these issues, some adjustments to the initial employment estimates for Electrical & Optical Equipment and Textiles, Textile Products, Leather and Footwear have been done."

    "output": "After 2005, the employment series for Electrical & Optical Equipment has been estimated by applying annual growth rates obtained from ASI and NSSO rounds to the number of employed persons for the year 2005-06. Then, for the years 2005-06 to 2011-12, the difference between the estimated employment series from EUS rounds and that based on ASI & NSSO rounds for the Electrical and Optical Equipment industry is computed and added to the Textiles, Textile Products, Leather and Footwear industry. This ensures that for manufacturing as a whole, the estimates remain the same as obtained from EUS rounds.\n\nTo measure the quality index, the present study has computed a labor quality index by using only education characteristic in the JGF methodology. Thus, the data required for the labour quality index in the present case, is employment and earnings by education and by industry. The labour quality index has been computed using five education categories namely- up to primary, primary, middle, secondary & higher secondary, and above higher secondary. There are thus five types of persons employed for each of the 27 study industries. The quality growth rates are estimated for total persons employed in these industries in India for the 38th, 50th, 55th, 61st, 68th and PLFS rounds of NSO. They are then indexed to 1983 (38th round) as the base, so as to assess the temporal changes in labour\u2019s skill and interpolation has been done between the major rounds for values of the intermediate years. Since the series is required from 1980-81, it has been extrapolated backwards from 1983 and the index is recomputed with base 1980-81 equal to 100. The following steps have been performed:\n\n1.  Compute the distribution of persons employed by the five educational groups for all the 27 industries for the selected major rounds of EUS and PLFS.\n2.  Apply these proportions to the number of employed persons in different industries in the major rounds and PLFS to obtain the distribution of persons by education groups.\n3.

This equation is corrected for sample selection bias using Heckman\u2019s two-step procedure. The Mincer function is applied to the earnings of casual and regular employees, where earnings are regressed on dummies of age, gender, education, location (rural or urban), marital status, social exclusion, and industry. The corresponding earnings of the self-employed are obtained as the predicted value with similar traits. Average wages per day are then computed for persons employed of different employment types (self-employed, regular, and casual combined) whose wages are available. Based on these steps, the labor quality index is estimated using equation 4.1, which accounts for changes in the composition of workers."

    "output": "The labour input (adjusted labour persons) can be obtained by multiplying the number of persons employed by the corresponding labour quality index, and the labour input growth is finally obtained by combining the growth of persons employed and the growth in the index of labour quality. The surveys of NSSO on employment and unemployment (EUS) aim to measure the extent of \u2018employment\u2019 and \u2018unemployment\u2019 in quantitative terms disaggregated by various household and population characteristics following the three reference periods of (i) one year, (ii) one week, and (iii) each day of the week. Based on these three reference periods three different measures, termed as usual status, current weekly status, and the current daily status, are arrived at. While all these three approaches are used for collection of data on employment and unemployment in the quinquennial surveys, the first two approaches only are used for the purpose in the annual surveys.\nUsual principal status: In NSS 27th round, the usual principal activity category of the persons was determined by considering the normal working pattern, i.e., the activity pursued by them over a long period in the past and which was likely to continue in the future. For the identification of the usual principal status of an individual based on the major time criterion, in NSS 27th, 32nd, 38th, 43rd rounds, a trichotomous classification of the population was followed, that is, a person was classified into one of the three broad groups \u2018employed\u2019, \u2018unemployed\u2019 and \u2018out of labour force\u2019 based on the major time criterion. From NSS 50th round onwards, the procedure was changed and the prescribed procedure was a two -stage dichotomous one which involved a classification into \u2018labour force\u2019 and \u2018out  labour force\u2019 in the first stage, and thereafter, the labour force into \u2018employed\u2019 and \u2018unemployed\u2019 in the second stage.\nUsual subsidiary status: In the usual status approach, besides principal status, information in respect of subsidiary economic status of an individual was collected in all employment and unemployment surveys. For deciding the subsidiary economic status of an individual, no minimum number of days of work during the last 365 days was mentioned prior to NSS 61 st round. In NSS 61st round, a minimum of 30 days of work, among other things, during the last 365 days, was considered necessary for classification as usual subsidiary economic activity of an individual.\nCurrent weekly status: In the EUS of NSSO, a person is considered as worker if he/she has performed any economic activity at least for one hour on any day of the reference week and uses the priority criteria in assigning work activity status. This definition is consistent with the ILO convention and used by most of the countries in the world for their labour force surveys. In NSSO, prior to NSS 50th round and in all the annual surveys till NSS 59th round, data on employment and unemployment in the CWS approach was collected by putting"

Prior to NSS 50th round and in all annual surveys till NSS 59th round, data on employment and unemployment in the CWS approach was collected by asking a single-shot question of whether the individual worked for at least one hour on any day during the last 7 days preceding the date of survey. This procedure was criticized for being unable to identify the entire workforce, particularly among women. It was then decided to derive the CWS of a person from the time disposition of the household members for the 7 days preceding the date of survey. This procedure was used for the first time in NSS 50th round. The change in the method of determining the current weekly activity resulted in increasing the WPR in the current weekly status approach, more so for females in both rural and urban areas than for males. The trend observed in NSS 50th round in respect of the WPR according to CWS suggested continuing with the procedure for data collection in CWS in NSS 55th and NSS 61st rounds."

    "output": "The methodology employed to estimate capital input for the 27 industries in the India KLEMS database version 2022 uses capital services as an input to production, estimated using the approach developed by Jorgenson and Griliches (1967), and outlined in Jorgenson, Gollop, and Fraumeni (1987). The estimation of capital service growth rates involves estimating capital stock for different capital assets and then aggregating across assets after correcting for the differences in their marginal productivities. Capital services account for the differences in marginal productivity between different asset types, while capital stock measures only the vintages of capital without accounting for asset heterogeneity. Capital stock is reported in constant price volumes and growth rates, while capital services are reported in growth rates and indices. To measure capital services, estimates of capital stock for detailed asset types and the shares of each of these assets in total capital remuneration are needed. The aggregate capital services growth rate is derived as a weighted growth rate of individual capital assets, using the formula \u2206 ln \ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc61 = \u2211 \ud835\udc63\u0305\ud835\udc58,\ud835\udc61\u2206 ln \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc58,\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc58, where \u2206 ln \ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc61 is the aggregate capital service growth rate, \u2206 ln \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc58,\ud835\udc61 is the volume growth of capital asset k, and the weights \ud835\udc63\u0305\ud835\udc58,\ud835\udc61 are the average shares of each asset in the value of total capital compensation in two periods such that the sum of shares over all capital types add to unity, calculated as \ud835\udc63\u0305\ud835\udc58,\ud835\udc61 = 0.5 \u00d7 (\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc58,\ud835\udc61 + \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc58,\ud835\udc61\u22121), and \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc58,\ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc58,\ud835\udc61 \ud835\udc3e \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc58,\ud835\udc61 \u2211 \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc58,\ud835\udc61 \ud835\udc3e \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc58,\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc58."

    "output": "\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc58,\ud835\udc61\n\ud835\udc3e  is the rental or user cost of capital asset type k in year t. The numerator, which is the product of user cost of asset k and the capital stock of asset k, is the capital compensation received by asset k. The numerator is the sum of compensation received by assets, or the total capital compensation, and therefore \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc58,\ud835\udc61 is the share of asset k in total capital compensation. Under the neoclassical assumption of price -marginal product equality, it effectively incorporates the productivity or qualitative differences in the contribution of various asset types to aggregate capital services, as the composition of aggregate capital stock in any industry changes. For instance, as the marginal productivity of ICT capital is higher than that of other assets, a change in the composition of capital towards ICT capital will result in higher capital services, which will be captured by a larger value of the v for ICT assets.\n\nTwo important components of capital service measure are the asset wise capital stock, \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc58,\ud835\udc61 and the service price (rental price) of capital assets, \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc58,\ud835\udc61\n\ud835\udc3e . Assuming a geometric depreciation rate, \ud835\udeff\ud835\udc58 which is constant over time, but different for each asset type, capital stock in asset k in year t can be constructed using Perpetual Inventory Method (PIM) as: \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc58,\ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc58,\ud835\udc61\u22121(1 \u2212 \ud835\udeff\ud835\udc58) + \ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc58,\ud835\udc61 , where, \ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc58,\ud835\udc61 is the real investment in asset type k in period t.\n\nOnce we have the estimates of capital stock for each asset and the growth rates of aggregate capital services using equation (5.1) from the previous context, we can calculate the capital composition effect (\u2206 ln \ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc44\ud835\udc61) - or the effect of changing asset composition of capital stock. This can be obtained as \u2206 ln \ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc44\ud835\udc61 = \u2206 ln \ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc61 \u2212 \u2206 ln \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc61, where \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc61 = \u2211 \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc58,\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc58 . These growth rates can then be indexed to the base year to obtain a capital composition index(\ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc44\ud835\udc61), i.e. \ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc44\ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc44\ud835\udc61\u22121 \u00d7 e (\u2206 ln \ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc61\u2212\u2206 ln \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc61) for t>base year, and \ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc44\ud835\udc61 = 100 for t=base year.

    "output": "The capital services database was constructed using multiple sources of information, including the National Accounts Statistics (NAS), the Annual Survey of Industries (ASI), National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) rounds for unorganized manufacturing, and various Input-Output tables. Even though multiple sources of data are used, the final estimates are fully consistent with the aggregate data obtained from the NAS. The approach to capital measurement is consistent with international practices such as the EU KLEMS, which ensures the possibility of international comparisons. For industry-level estimates of capital input, NAS provides information on aggregate capital formation by industry of use for nine broad sectors. More detailed data on assets and industries was collected from the CSO. For sectors where investment matrices were unavailable from CSO, information was gathered from other sources (e.g., ASI for organized manufacturing and NSSO surveys for unorganized manufacturing) and benchmarked to the aggregate investment series from the National Accounts. The data used in the current version of the India KLEMS is based on the revised NAS with 2011-2012 base and is available only since 2012. Therefore, for earlier years, the series are extrapolated using growth rates from previous versions of the data. Investment in education and health are obtained directly from national accounts for the period after 2012, for each asset. For years before 2012, the trend in the distribution of output is assumed, in order to split the total investment in the aggregates of these sectors into sub-sectors."

    "output": "Total investment in each asset category is calculated as the sum of private and public sector investment in each asset. Since investment in transport equipment was not available separately for the private sector industries, the NAS total machinery in the private sector was distributed using the industry distribution of machinery and transport equipment. These estimates are then subtracted from each industry\u2019s total machinery & transport equipment data to obtain the transport equipment investment in the private sector industries. This approach allowed the generation of investment in transport equipment by industries for the period 1950-2016. The share of transport equipment in the total machinery and equipment group in 2016-2017 was assumed to remain constant to create nominal investment in transport equipment in the subsequent years, which was then deflated using the GFCF deflator for transport equipment. Since the distinction between registered and unregistered manufacturing is not available in the NAS since 2016, the household sector is considered as a proxy for unregistered, and the corporate and public sector as a proxy for the registered sector.\n\nUpdates for years since 2017-2018 are based on published aggregate GFCF data from the National Accounts. The published NAS series is used as the benchmark since 2012. The industry distribution of the 2012-2016 detailed series obtained previously from the CSO is then applied.

This approach is based on a single year\u2019s sample and helps to avoid potential huge negative investment series and is consistent with published ASI GFCF series.\n\nThe yearly detailed volumes beginning 1964-65 were used to derive the gross fixed capital formation by asset type directly.

For the period 1983-84 to 2004-05, ASI has generated detailed tables from Block C of the ASI schedule that contain data on fixed assets. Data for missing years are interpolated using the changes in investment using the book value method. Table 5.2 provides an overview of the asset categories available in ASI, and the relevant asset categories in our study to which they are attributed. Though ASI provides investment in land, for reasons of NAS consistency, it is excluded from our database.\n\nOnce investment in each of these assets and industries are generated using ASI data, this industry-asset distribution is applied to the published aggregate NAS GFCF series for the organized manufacturing sector. From 1960-61 to 1971-72, ASI data are for the census sector, and from 1973-74 onwards, they are for the factory sector. To make these two series comparable over years, the data prior to 1972 is converted to the factory sector."

    "input": "Question: How is gross investment data created for both registered and unregistered manufacturing sectors, and how are investment prices by asset types determined?",
    "output": "For registered (organized) manufacturing, investment data for 13 manufacturing sectors, by asset types, are obtained after adjustments to ensure consistency with the NAS aggregate for registered manufacturing. Specifically, data prior to 1972 is converted to the factory sector using the factory/census ratio in 1973. For years after 2016, registered manufacturing is proxied by the sum of the public sector and corporate sector since NAS does not provide registered manufacturing aggregates. For unregistered (unorganized) manufacturing, gross investment series for the 13 sectors are derived from various rounds of NSSO surveys covering the period 1989-2016. The investment series are interpolated to obtain annual time series of unorganized gross fixed capital formation by asset type, and the asset-industry distribution is applied to the published NAS aggregate GFCF in unregistered manufacturing to obtain NAS-consistent GFCF by asset type and industries.\n\nTo compute asset-wise capital stock, asset-wise investment price deflators are required. These deflators are derived using investment data by industries and assets in current and constant prices, with a base year of 2011-2012. Prices for years before 2011 were spliced using 2004-2005 base investment deflators. For 2017-2018, the investment deflator for transport equipment was extrapolated using the trend in the investment price of total machinery & equipment from NAS."

    "output": "For manufacturing sectors, the net fixed capital stock is taken for the year 1964, driven by the availability of ASI data. Since the NAS estimate is only available for broad sectors and aggregate capital, the industry-asset distribution of GFCF is used to create net fixed capital stock estimates by asset type for all 27 sectors. The approach to split asset-wise capital stock was changed in the 2020 version of the India KLEMS database; instead of using the GFCF distribution, the distribution of net capital stock by assets, available from detailed asset data obtained from the CSO, is used. To derive appropriate depreciation rates for non-ICT assets, estimates of lifetime from NAS are used, assuming 80 years for buildings, 20 years for transport equipment, and 25 years for machinery and equipment, and applying a double declining balance rate. Capital stock series are built by asset types for all 27 industries using GFCF series from 1950 (for non-manufacturing) or 1964 (for manufacturing) onwards. The measure of capital input is arrived at using equation (5.1), and it requires estimates of rental prices. Assuming that the flow of capital services is proportional to the capital stock at the individual asset level, aggregate capital flows can be obtained using a translog quantity index by weighting growth in the stock of each asset by the average shares of each asset in the value of capital compensation, as in (5.1). The rate of return (i) in equation (5.4) represents the opportunity cost of capital."

    "output": "The present version of the India KLEMS database uses an external rate of return, proxied by the average of return on government securities and prime lending rate obtained from the Reserve Bank of India. Therefore, a real rate is used, which is net of capital gain, and the capital gain component in equation is excluded while estimating rental price using the formula \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc58,\ud835\udc61\n\ud835\udc3e = \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc58,\ud835\udc61\u22121\n\ud835\udc3c \u2219 \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc61 + \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc58,\ud835\udc61\n\ud835\udc3c \u2219 \ud835\udeff\ud835\udc58 (5.4) where r is the real rate of return (nominal interest rate adjusted for consumer price inflation rate), and the consumer price indices (CPI) are obtained from IMF and World Bank.\n\nThe measures of capital input available in India KLEMS are based on only three asset categories: construction, machinery, and transport equipment. Therefore, it does not consider the role of ICT capital in contributing to productivity and growth, due to insufficient data on investment in ICT assets. NAS has extended its asset coverage to include software and ICT equipment, and future extensions of the database may explore this. Additionally, following the SNA 2008 guidelines, the NAS now provides estimates of intangible capital such as intellectual property and research and development (R&D), which may be a useful extension to the capital input database.\n\nTwo additional challenges are arising since the new system of national accounts: the lack of separate data on registered and unregistered manufacturing, and the lack of separate data on transport equipment and machinery assets. The former is currently addressed by considering the household sector as unregistered manufacturing and the sum of public and corporate sectors as a registered sector."

In the future, it might necessitate combining transport equipment and machinery to one single asset. Finally, the debate on whether it is appropriate to use an external rate of return or an internal rate of return is unsettled in the literature, and it may be worth exploring estimates of capital using the internal rate of return."

    "output": "The rental price of capital \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc58,\ud835\udc61\n\ud835\udc3e reflects the price at which the investor is indifferent between buying and renting the capital good for a one-year lease in the rental market. In the absence of taxation, the rental price equation can be derived as the sum of the nominal rate of return, the nominal cost of depreciation, less capital gain (see Jorgenson and Griliches, 1967; and Christensen and Jorgenson, 1969):\n\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc58,\ud835\udc61\n\ud835\udc3e = \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc58,\ud835\udc61\u22121\n\ud835\udc3c \u2219 \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61 + \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc58,\ud835\udc61\n\ud835\udc3c \u2219 \ud835\udeff\ud835\udc58 \u2212 (\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc58,\ud835\udc61\n\ud835\udc3c \u2212 \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc58,\ud835\udc61\u22121\n\ud835\udc3c ) (5.4)\nwhere \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc58,\ud835\udc61\n\ud835\udc3c is the investment price (or acquisition price) of asset k in year t, and \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61 is the nominal rate of return. The first component is the rate of return component, which captures the opportunity cost of purchasing a capital asset. The second component is the depreciation component, and the last component, which is the difference between investment prices in year t and t-1, captures the capital gain. Thus, this formula shows that the rental price is determined by the nominal rate of return, economic depreciation costs, and asset-specific capital gains. The rate of return i in equation (5.4) can be measured either as an internal or ex-post rate of return \u2013 using the information on realized capital compensation \u2013 or an external or ex-ante rate of return \u2013 such as the prevailing long-term interest rate in the economy. There is continuing debate on which rate is more appropriate for productivity analysis. Empirical evidence suggests that the choice of a particular rate may impact final estimates of capital services and productivity (see Oulton, 2007; Erumban, 2008a). In India KLEMS, following the arguments that investors make their investment decisions considering the prevailing interest rates in the economy, we use an external rate of return (see more details in section 2.4). Ideally taxes should be included to account for differences in tax treatment of the different asset types and different legal forms (household, corporate and non-corporate). The capital service price formulas above should then be adjusted to take these tax rates into account. However, this refinement would require data on capital tax allowances and rates by industry and year, which is beyond the scope of this database. Available evidence for major European countries shows that the inclusion of tax rates has only a very minor effect on growth rates of capital services and TFPG (Erumban, 2008a)."

    "output": "In Chapter 6, the basic approach used to derive the volume series of Intermediate Inputs \u2013 namely Energy input (E), Material input (M), and Services input (S) is described. The methodology for measuring industry output, intermediate inputs, and value added was developed by Jorgenson, Gallop, and Fraumeni (1987) and extended by Jorgenson (1990 a). The cornerstone of this approach is a time series of input-output (IO) tables which gives the flows of all commodities in the economy, as well as payments to primary factors. Following a similar approach as explained in Jorgenson et al. (2005, Chapter 4) and Timmer et al. (2010, Chapter 3), the time series on intermediate inputs for the India KLEMS project have been constructed. This study identifies three main categories of Intermediate inputs: Energy Input, Material Input, and Service Input. The five energy types classified as Energy input are: Coal and Lignite, Petroleum products, Electricity (except for electricity used in the electricity sector, which is treated as material), Natural gas, and Gas (LPG). The fourteen input items classified as the Service input are: Water supply, Railway transport services, Other transport services, Storage and warehousing, Communication, Trade, and Hotels and restaurants."

Step 1: Concordance is done between IOTT and study industries. The 60/115/130 IOTT industries are aggregated to form industries. A concordance table between the classification used in our study and each Input Output Transaction Table has been prepared. Step 2: Obtaining estimates for Material, Energy and Service Inputs for 27 Industries, in benchmark years: 1. In IOTT, no intermediate input is being used in industry 24 \u2013 \u2018Public Administration\u2019. Consequently, the intermediate input series is being directly estimated for only 26 industries from 1980 to 2019. However, we have used \u2018Net Purchase of Commodities and Services\u2019 of Administrative Department as total intermediate input. And using information about \u2018Government Final Consumption Expenditure\u2019 we distribute the total intermediate input in to material, energy and services input. 2.

    "output": "A time series (1980 to 2019) of proportions of Material, Energy and Service Inputs in Total Intermediate Inputs for each of the 27 industries is projected as follows:\n\n1.  For the Benchmark years i.e., 1978, 1983, 1989, 1993, 1998, 2003, 2007 and 2015 proportions of Material Inputs, Energy Inputs, and Service Inputs in Total Intermediate Inputs are calculated.\n2.  Similar proportion for intervening years is obtained by linear interpolation of the benchmark proportions.\n3.  This gives a time series of proportions of Material, Energy and Service Inputs in Total Intermediate Inputs for each year, from 1980 to 2019.\n4.  Thus, using IOTT, the intermediate input vector has been projected for 27 study industries from 1980 to 2019.\n\nIf there exists some abnormal fluctuation in the proportions of Material Inputs, Energy Inputs, and Service Inputs in Total Intermediate Inputs for benchmark years, that specific benchmark proportion is dropped, and linear interpolation of the adjacent benchmark proportions is used to estimate proportion for intervening years. For the industry \u2018Wood & Wood Products\u2019, proportions of Material Inputs, Energy Inputs, and Service Inputs in Total Intermediate Inputs are estimated from SUT 2015-16 instead of Input Output Transaction Table 2015-16.\n\nFor the industry group \u2018Coke, Refined Petroleum and Nuclear Fuel\u2019, proportions of Material Inputs, Energy Inputs, and Service Inputs in Total Intermediate Inputs are estimated from ASI data instead of Input Output Transaction Table. This is done because the relevant proportions differed significantly between the input-out tables and ASI, and the latter is believed to be making a more correct assessment of energy inputs used in the Coke and Petroleum products industry."

    "output": "The projection of intermediate input vector, using IOTT needs to be consistent with the estimated output from NAS. This involves two steps:\n1. For Benchmark years: Ratio of Total Intermediate inputs from NAS to that from IOTT is adjusted proportionately to the absolute value of Energy Inputs/Material Inputs/Service Inputs obtained from IOTT.\n2. For Intervening Years: The interpolated proportions of Energy Inputs, Material Inputs and Services Inputs obtained from IOTT, is applied directly to the total intermediate inputs from NAS to get each inputs share. These steps give a time series of Material, Energy, and Service Inputs for 27 study Industries from 1980 to 2019 at current prices.\nTo compute the Intermediate Input Series for 27 study Industries from 1980 to 2019 at constant price, deflators of Materials, Energy and Service Inputs are developed for each of the 27 study Industries separately. Deflators are obtained for each of the 115 (IOTT 1989 and 1998) and 130 (IOTT 2007) commodity inputs. WPI for the period 1980 to 2019 is taken from Office of the Economic Adviser, Ministry of Commerce and Industry. Best available Wholesale Price Index is applied to each commodity input in the IOTT. In several cases, no proper WPI is available for the sector; hence the best among the available has been chosen. In some cases, the right index has been formed from item level indices. In some case, one index has been removed from a higher -level aggregate to generate the right index. For Electricity as an input entering into the production process of an industry, depending on the nature of economic activity, the right price of electricity has been chosen. For instance, in the case of manufacturing industries, the price of electricity for industry considered, similarly for agriculture the price of electricity for agriculture. For natural gas from 2004 to 2020 the price information is taken from Indian Petroleum and Natural Gas Statistics.

The Off-shore price was used to prepare the price index, with the base year as 2011-12=100.

For the intervening years, 1998-99 to 2002-03, the price was estimated within the range of Rs 2150-2850 per Kscm, based on assumptions about the link with international fuel oil prices. Specifically, the bottom of the range was used for 1998-99, the mid-point for 1999-2000 and 2001-02, and the end point for 2002-03.

    "output": "The distribution of income between capital, labour and intermediate inputs, is an important element in growth accounting because income shares, under conditions of competitive markets, can be used to measure the contributions each factor makes towards output growth. Under the assumption of constant returns to scale with two factors of production i.e., labour and capital, the sum of the labour income share and capital income share is 1. The labour income share is defined as the ratio of labour income to GVA. Capital income share is accordingly obtained as one minus labour income share."

    "input": "Question: What data sources and steps are involved in computing the labor income share for the 27 study industries?",
    "output": "The computation of labor income share utilizes NAS, ASI, and unit level data of surveys of unorganized manufacturing enterprises to obtain estimates of CE, OS, and MI for each of the 27 study industries. To separate the labor and non-labor components from the mixed income of self-employed individuals, unit level data from the NSS employment-unemployment survey are used alongside CE, OS, and MI estimates primarily sourced from NAS. The estimation involves two main steps: Step 1 focuses on estimating CE, OS, and MI for the 27 study industries using NAS data and ASI data to distribute NAS estimates across study industries. Specifically, NAS estimates of factor incomes for registered manufacturing are split into KLMES 13 industries in proportion to reported ASI data on emoluments. Similarly, estimates of factor incomes for 'other services' in NAS are split into Education, Health and Social Work, and Other Community, Social and Personal Services including Renting of Machinery and Business Services, and Private Household with Employed Persons. For manufacturing industries before 2011-12, NAS provides estimates for registered and unregistered manufacturing, while from 2011-12 onwards, NAS disaggregates the manufacturing sector into corporate and household sectors, requiring NAS estimates to be split using ASI data."

    "output": "For registered manufacturing and corporate sector, the NAS estimates of factor incomes are distributed into 13 industries in proportion to the reported ASI data on emoluments for various industries. Emoluments are subtracted from gross value added for various industries yielding capital income, and the share of different industries in aggregate capital income of organized manufacturing (indicated by the ASI data) is used to split the estimate of OS for registered manufacturing and corporate sector reported in the NAS.\n\nThe methodology applied for unregistered manufacturing and household sector is similar, utilizing published results and unit level data of survey of unorganized manufacturing industries. The estimates of wage payments (to hired workers) in different industries are used to proportionally split the estimate of CE in the NAS for aggregate unregistered manufacturing. The estimated wage payment is subtracted from the estimated value added to obtain an estimate of capital income and mixed income of the self -employed in various unorganized manufacturing industries. The estimate of MI provided in NAS for unregistered manufacturing and household sector is then proportionately distributed across industries using the estimate of capital income and mixed income of the self-employed in various industries that could be formed on the basis of published results and unit level data of survey of unorganized manufacturing industries.\n\nData for unorganized manufacturing enterprises are available only for select years (45th Round (1989-90), 51st Round (1994-95), 56th Round (2000-01), 62nd Round (2005-06), 67th round (2010-11) and 73rd Round (2015-16)), requiring interpolation/extrapolation to obtain the relevant proportions for other years."

    "output": "The estimation method of \ud835\udf02 needs to be described. The derivation of the GVA series for different industries has been briefly explained in Chapter 2. The derivation of CE and MI series has been explained in step I above. The estimation of \ud835\udf02 has been done with the help of NSS survey-based estimates of employment of different categories of workers (number of persons and days of work) and wage rates (which has been described briefly in chapter 4) coupled with estimates of MI, basically obtained from the NAS. Two approaches have been taken to get an estimate of \ud835\udf02, and the labour income share series for different industries finally adopted in the study makes use of an average of the estimates of \ud835\udf02 obtained by the two approaches.\nIn the first approach, an estimate of labour income of self-employed workers has been made for each study industry for eight years, 1983-84, 1987-88, 1993-94, 1999-00, 2004-05, 2009-10, 2011-12 and 2015-16 on the basis of the estimated number of self-employed, wage rate of self-employed and the number of days of work per week. The industry-wise estimates of number of self-employed, wage rate of self-employed and the number of days of work per week have been made from unit records of NSS employment-unemployment survey (major rounds) of 1983, 1993-94, 1999-00, 2004-05, 2011-12, and PLFS of 2018-19 and 2019-20.\nThe estimates of the number of self-employed, wage rate of self-employed and the number of days of work per week provide an estimate of the annul labour income of self-employed workers which is divided by the mixed income of self-employed (derived from NAS) to get an estimate of \ud835\udf02. For five industries, the ratio in question has been computed and applied. For the other 22 industries, the ratio in question has been computed after clubbing the industries into 11 industry groups. In the latter case, a common ratio computed for group of industries has then been applied to constituent industries. The list of industries or industry groups for which \ud835\udf02 has been estimated is given in table 7.2.\nIn the second approach, the NSS data are used to compute the following ratio: the ratio of labour income of self-employed workers to the labour income of regular and casual workers. Let this be denoted by \ud835\udf03. Then, the estimate of CE provided in the NAS is multiplied by \ud835\udf03 to obtain an estimate of the labour income component out of the MI reported in the NAS. The labour component of MI divided by total MI gives an estimate of \ud835\udf02. In case the estimated labour component of MI exceeds the estimate of MI, the estimate of \ud835\udf02 has been taken as unity.\nExamining the estimates obtained by the first approach, it was found that the estimated labour income share out of mixed income varied significantly among the estimates for the seven years for which the ratio in question has been estimated."

    "output": "The India KLEMS Database 2020 includes the following changes compared to the 2019 version:\n\nOverall changes:\nThe database has been extended to include data up to 2018-19 for all variables, providing a series for the period 1980-81 to 2018-19.\n\nVariable-specific changes:\n1. Gross Value Added: Estimates of Gross Value Added (GVA) for years since 2011-12, both current and constant (2011-12) prices for all industries, are obtained from National Accounts Statistics (NAS) 2021.\n2. Gross Value of Output: Estimates of Gross Value of Output (GVO) for years since 2011-12, both current and constant (2011-12) prices for all industries, are obtained from National Accounts Statistics (NAS) 2021.\n3. Labour Input: The latest Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) by NSSO for 2018-19 on employment is used for estimating employment for 2018-19.\n4. Capital Input:\n   I. Data on investment, capital stock, and capital services for 2018-2019 are added.\n   II. Detailed asset/industry-wise data on capital formation was previously obtained from the CSO. The CSO provided two historical series: one in 2004-2005 base (from 1950-51 to 2012-2013) and another in 2011-2012 base (from 2011-2012 till 2016-2017). Since this data was unavailable after 2016-2017, the current and previous updates of the India KLEMS rely solely on publicly available data from the NAS for years after 2016.\n   III. Given that CSO now provides more detailed public data, it was largely consistent with previous data. One issue was that the asset transport equipment was not separately available. Therefore, the share of transport equipment in the total machinery and equipment group in 2016-2017 was assumed to remain constant in subsequent years.\n   IV. The split is done for current price series. For deflating the assets, asset prices are extrapolated using the trend in the nearest aggregate asset (e.g., transport equipment is deflated using the extrapolated investment price of total machinery).\n   V. The National Accounts no longer provide the split between registered and unregistered manufacturing. Therefore, it is hard to create the control total for these two."

    "output": "The changes related to capital input in the India KLEMS Database 2020 over the 2019 version are as follows:\n\nI. Data on investment, capital stock, and capital services for 2018-2019 are added.\nII. The database now considers the household sector as a proxy for unregistered and the corporate and public sector as a proxy for the registered sector to create the industry series using data from the Annual Survey of Industries and NSSO unorganized manufacturing surveys.\nIII. The NAS-published headline series is considered as the benchmark since 2012 while extending the detailed asset-wise investment series forward, applying the industry distribution of the 2012-2016 detailed series obtained previously from the CSO.\nIV. The approach to estimating initial capital stock by asset types has been changed; instead of distributing NAS estimates of net capital stock in the initial year using the asset distribution of GFCF, the industry distribution of net capital stock is now used.\nV. Extrapolation of the 2011-2012 base GFCF series backward to 1950 using the 2004-2005 base back series is now made at the level of KLEMS industry aggregates.\nVI. This version of the database provides aggregate capital stock at current prices and aggregate capital composition index for the 27 industries."

    "input": "Question: What procedures, methodologies, and approaches are described in the India KLEMS database version 2020, and what is the purpose of this database?",
    "output": "Chapter 1 of the India KLEMS database version 2020 describes the procedures, methodologies, and approaches used in its construction. This database is part of a research project, supported by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), to analyze productivity performance in the Indian economy at a disaggregate industry level. This work aims to support empirical research in the area of economic growth and to support the conduct of policies aimed at accelerating productivity growth in the Indian economy by providing comprehensive measurement tools to monitor and evaluate progress. Additionally, the database supports the systematic production of reliable statistics on growth and productivity using the methodologies of national accounts and input-output analysis. The India KLEMS research project includes measures of economic growth, employment creation, capital formation, and productivity at the industry level from 1980-81 onwards, incorporating categories of Capital (K), Labour (L), Energy (E), Materials (M), and Services (S) inputs. A major advantage of growth accounts is that they are embedded in a clear analytical framework rooted in production functions and the theory of economic growth, providing a conceptual framework for analyzing the interaction between variables, which is crucial for policy evaluation. The present version is an extended project undertaken at the Centre for Development Economics, Delhi School of Economics, building on a previous project at ICRIER, New Delhi. The Data Manual guides researchers on the variables used to measure inputs and total factor productivity (TFP) at the industry level, and it also supports national officials\u2019 statistical agencies in future work on the productivity database. The dataset includes measures of Gross Value Added (GVA), Gross Value of Output (GVO), Labour (L), Capital (K), Energy (E), Material (M), Services (S), Labour Quality (LQ), Labour Productivity (LP), and Total Factor Productivity (TFP) at the industry and economy level from 1980-81 onwards, covering the period 1980-81 to 2018-19."

    "input": "Question: What does Chapter 2 discuss regarding the Gross Value-Added Series at the Industry Level, including methodology and data sources?",
    "output": "Chapter 2 discusses the Gross Value-Added Series at the Industry Level. It explains that productivity measures for a firm or industry can be based on a value-added concept, where value added is an industry\u2019s output and primary inputs like labor and capital are industry inputs. These measures reflect an industry\u2019s capacity to contribute to economy-wide income and final demand, complementing gross output-based measures. This chapter describes the data sources and methodology used to construct the Gross Value Added (GVA) series at current and constant prices for 27 study industries for the period of 1980-81 (1980) to 2018-19 (2018).\n\nGVA of a sector is defined as the value of output less the value of its intermediary inputs. This value added created by a sector is shared among the primary factors of production, labour and capital. The National Accounts Statistics (NAS) brought out by the CSO (Central Statistics Office, Government of India) is the basic source of data for the construction of series on gross value added for INDIA KLEMS -industries. NAS provides estimates of GVA (i.e., gross value added) at a disaggregate d industry level at both current and constant prices for the period since 1950 -51. Up to 2011-12, estimates of GVA at both current and constant (2011-12) prices for all industries are obta ined from Back Series  of National Accounts (Base 2011-12). For years after 2011 -12, they are directly obtained from NAS 20 21. However, NAS estimates of value added are not available for a few India KLEMS industry groups. Therefore, some of the aggregate industry groups from NAS were split.\n\nIn previous versions of the India KLEMS data, value -added was measured at factor cost (as was the case with the NAS). However, this was not fully consistent with the KLEMS standards used internationally, as the international standards of KLEMS methodology were to follow value added at basic prices. The difference between value added at factor cost and value added at basic price is the treatment of taxes and subsidies on production. While the former excludes all taxes on production and includes all subsidies (on intermediate inputs and factor inputs) , the latter includes only taxes and subsidies on intermediate inputs. In practice, gross value added at basic prices is measured as output valued at basic prices less intermediate consumption valued at purchasers' prices. The basic price is the amount rec eivable by the producer from the purchaser for a unit of a good or service produced as output minus any tax payable, and plus any subsidy receivable, on that unit as a consequence of its production or sale. It excludes any transport charges invoiced separately by the producer. Although the outputs and inputs are valued using different sets of prices, for brevity the value added is described by the prices used to value the outputs. From the point of view of the producer, purchasers' prices for inputs and bas ic prices for outputs represent the prices actually paid and received. Their use leads to a measure of gross value added which is particularly relevant for the producer. Gross value added at factor cost can easily be derived from the measures of gross valu e added at basic prices presented above by subtracting the value of any taxes, less subsidies, on production payable out of gross value added as defined. For example, the only taxes on production remaining to be paid out of gross value added at basic prices consist of \"other taxes on production\". These consist mostly of current taxes (or subsidies) on the labour or capital employed in the enterprise, such as payroll taxes or current taxes on vehicles or buildings. Gross value added at factor cost can, there fore, be derived from gross value added at basic prices by subtracting \"other taxes, less subsidies, on production.\""

    "input": "Question: How did the India KLEMS database address inconsistencies with KLEMS standards and maintain consistency with the National Accounts Statistics (NAS) regarding gross value added?",
    "output": "The India KLEMS database addressed inconsistencies with the KLEMS standards by adopting the NAS's shift to providing value added at basic prices since 2011-2012, following the SNA. This allowed the database to bypass the previous inconsistency while maintaining consistency with the NAS, which now entirely uses the basic price concept. NAS provides separate estimates of GVA for registered and unregistered manufacturing. However, onwards 2011-12 NAS has disaggregated the manufacturing sector into corporate sector and household sector. For splitting the aggregate estimates of GVA for registered manufacturing industries and the corporate sector, data from the Annual Survey of Industries (ASI) based on the National Industrial Classification 2004 and 2008 (NIC -2004 & NIC-2008) have been used. Whereas, for the unregistered manufacturing sector, results from six rounds of NSSO surveys- [40th (1984-85), 45th round (1989-90), 51st round (1994-95) 56th round (2000-01), 62 nd round (2005-06), 67th round (2010-11) and 73 rd round (2015-16)] have been used to obtain the value-added estimates. In India, GDP for unregistered manufacturing is constructed using the labour input method. The estimates of GVA for the unregistered manufacturing sector are obtained as a product of the workforce and the corresponding GVA per worker. The information about employment in the unorganized sector is only available in the benchmark years for which NSSO survey data are available. Therefore, there is no consistent source of employment data for the years between these quinquennial surveys. Even the information on value added per worker is equally limited since the value -added data are also updated on an approximate 5 -year interval (for details, see CSO, 2007). Therefore, estimates of value added for the unregistered manufacturing sectors for the years between the benchmarks have been obtained by interpolation and for years outside the benchmark years by linear extrapolation. For splitting the aggregate estimates of GVA for the household sector for recent years (i.e., 2011 onwards), GVA data from 67th round (2010-11) and 73rd round (2015-16) has been used."

    "output": "This chapter describes the procedures and methodologies used in constructing the database for gross output series at the industry level over the period 1980 -81(1980) to 2018-19(2018). We discuss both the raw data sources and the adjustments that have been made to generate the time series on output and value added consistent with the official National Accounts. The methodology for measuring industry output, and value added was developed by Jorgenson, Gallop and Fraumeni (1987) and extended by Jorgenson (1990 a). Following a similar approach as explained in Jorgenson et al. (2005, Chapter 4) and Timmer et al. (2010, Chapter 3), the time series on gross output and intermediate inputs for the Indian economy have been constructed. The gross output of an industry is defined as the value of industry production using primary factors like labour, capital and intermediate inputs purchased from other industries . The gross output production function assumes separability in inputs and technology. An important advantage of the gross output approach is that it provides a complete measure of production and treats all inputs - labour, capital and intermediate inputs symmetrically. In contrast , the value-added measure of output does not explicitly account for the flow of intermediate inputs which may be the primary component of an industry\u2019s output. The more restrictive value-added concept is used primarily because it is useful for aggregation purposes. It is to be noted that aggregate output (aggregated over industry value added), is a value-added concept and the detailed methodology of aggregation of output across industries is explained in chapter 8. To construct the gross output series at industry level , multiple data sources are used namely National Accounts Statistics, Annual Survey of Industries, NSSO rounds for unorganized manufacturing and Input Output Transaction tables. The National Accounts Statistics (NAS) is the basic source of data for the construction of time series on the gross output. The NAS back series 2011 with base 2004 -05 and NAS 2014 provides estimates of gross output for six disaggregate industries at current and constant prices since 1950 -51 till 2011-12. These sectors are Agriculture, Mining and Quarrying, Construction and Manufacturing sectors (Registered and Unregistered Manufacturing). However, the Back Series with base 2011-12, which is the source of GVA in India KLEMS database 2020, does not provide estimates of GVO for most of the industries except for Agriculture, Mining and Quarrying and Construction. For these three industries GVO data at current and constant prices directly obtained from Back Series with base 2011 -12. Therefore, for 1980-81 to 2011-12 period, the GVO series is estimated for remaining 24 industries at current and constant prices by applying the respective GVO/GVA ratio for current and constant prices obtained from Back"

    "output": "For years since 2011, estimates of Gross Value of Output (GVO) both at current and constant prices for all industries are taken directly from NAS 2021. To fill in the National Accounts Series, for a few industry groups at a more aggregate level, NAS estimates of output have been split using additional information from the Annual Survey of Industries (ASI) and NSSO rounds of Unregistered Manufacturing to obtain estimates at higher level of disaggregation. For Unregistered manufacturing gross output data is available in NAS from 2004-05 onwards, and information from NSSO survey rounds has been used for missing years to derive output estimates of unregistered manufacturing industries at current and constant prices.\n\nGross output data are available at a more disaggregated level in Annual Survey of Industries (ASI) and NSSO quinquennial surveys for Registered and Unregistered Manufacturing industries, respectively. These secondary data sources are used in this study for two purposes: (a) in certain cases NAS provides combined estimates of GVO and Gross Value Added (GVA) for two manufacturing industries. In such cases separate estimates for individual study industries are obtained with the help of ASI or NSSO unorganized manufacturing sector data. (b) For the period prior to 2004, NAS does not provide estimates of GVO for unorganized manufacturing industries. To make our estimate of GVO for this period, the NSSO data are used. The Major NSSO Rounds for Unregistered Manufacturing used are 40th Round (1984-85), 45th Round (1989-90) and 51st Round (1994-95), 56th Round (2000-01), 62nd Round (2005-06), 67th Round (2010-11) and 73rd Round (2015-16)."

    "output": "Step 1 involves measuring the Gross Output of the Agricultural Sector, Mining and Quarrying, and Construction. NAS provides nominal and real GVO series for a) Crops and Plantation, b) Animal Husbandry c) Forestry and Logging d) Fishing. By aggregating the GVO of these four subsectors, the GVO of the Agricultural sector is derived. The Gross output estimates of Mining and Quarrying and Construction at current and constant prices from 1980-2018 are also directly taken from NAS.\n\nStep 2 involves measuring the Gross Output of Manufacturing Industries. Time series on gross output is obtained by adding the magnitudes for registered and unregistered segments of manufacturing. NAS estimates of gross output for manufacturing industries are at a more aggregate level, and in such cases, the aggregate output of NAS at current prices has been split using additional information from ASI and NSSO unorganized sector reports. Since 2011-12, gross output data for 8 out of 13 manufacturing industries are directly picked up from NAS.

    "output": "Chapter 4 provides information on the sources of data and method of measuring labour services, aiming to estimate labour input reflecting actual changes in the quantity (number of persons) and quality of labour input over time. The construction of labor input for 27 industries from 1980 to 2018 combines data on labor persons and data on labor quality, ideally incorporating age, gender, and education to reflect embodied human capital. The contribution to output by each person also comes from this embodied capital and the reward (wages and earnings) to each person also includes the reward for investment in human capital.  However, limitations in India\u2019s employment statistics, particularly the availability of wage/earnings data for different worker categories, make it difficult to fully quantify changes in the labor force. Therefore, the study computes a labor quality index based on five education categories. To build a time series of employment for 27 industrial sectors, certain assumptions regarding annual changes in the employment series are made due to the lack of comprehensive time-series data, except for the organized segment. The primary data sources are the Employment and Unemployment Surveys (EUS) from the 38th to 68th rounds by the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) and the Periodic Labour Force Surveys (PLFS) of 2017-18 and 2018-19 by the National Statistical Organisation (NSO), which provide estimates for the total workforce by industry groups according to the National Industrial Classification (NIC)."

    "output": "Employment in India has been computed in a step-wise manner. First, Work Participation Rates (WPRs) by UPSS of the four components - Rural Male, Rural Female, Urban Male and Urban Female from EUS are applied to the corresponding period\u2019s census population to find out the number of persons employed in the four segments and the total employment. Second, the 27-industry distribution of Employment from EUS is applied to the number of persons employed in step I to obtain Lij for each industry where i=1 for rural and 2 for urban sectors, and j=1 for male and 2 for female for each round. Third, the estimates of employment for the intervening years between the major EUS rounds and PLFS 2017-18 have been obtained by simple interpolation of the four segments- rural male, rural females, urban male and the urban females, ignoring the outliers where the two closest rounds have then been used for interpolation. While, the estimates from the major rounds are centred around the mid-year of the survey rounds, i.e July for 38th round and 1st Jan for the other rounds; the interpolation has been centred around 1st October so as to coincide with the mid-year of the national income estimates which refer to the financial year. So, the base is shifted to October of each year while interpolating the values. Fourth, total persons in a year were then obtained for each industry as the sum of the Lij over gender and sectors, i.e., \u03a3i\u03a3jLij. For extrapolation backward to 1980-81 to 1982-83, the interpolation of the broad industrial classification of 32nd round (1977-78) and 38thround (1983-84) is used; the estimates from 32nd round are mainly used as control numbers. Between the survey periods interpolation of estimates was done to find employment for the intervening period. However, in few survey periods where the disaggregate employment of an industry was an outlier, it was ignored for interpolation and the interpolation in such cases was done between the other two adjacent rounds. Between 2005 and 2011, there was a very high growth rate in the number of employed persons series for the industry Electrical and Optical Equipment as compared to other manufacturing industries and the overall growth in employment in this industry during 2005-2011 was found to be higher than that for Construction (which seems somewhat unrealistic)."

This ensures that for the manufacturing as a whole our estimates remain the same as obtained from EUS rounds."

    "input": "Question: How can the growth of labor input be split, and how is labor quality growth calculated?",
    "output": "The implied assumption is that each worker category is paid their marginal productivities and marginal revenues are equal to marginal costs, so the weighting procedure ensures that inputs which have a higher price also have a larger influence in the input index. So, a doubling of the number of high-skilled persons worked gets a bigger weight than a doubling of number of low-skilled persons worked. Therefore, the volume growth of labor input as in equation 4.1 can be split into the growth of employment quantity or the number of employed persons and the changes in labour quality index, which is due to the changes in the composition of workers in terms. Let Hj indicate total persons worked in industry \u2018j\u2019 by all types \u2018l\u2019 in period \u2018t\u2019, then Hj,t = \u2211l Hl,j,t, then we can define the growth in employment as: \u2206 ln \ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc57,\ud835\udc61 = \u2206 ln \u2211 \ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc59,\ud835\udc57,\ud835\udc61 (4.3) and, labour quality growth as:  \u2206 ln \ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc57,\ud835\udc61 \u2212 \u2206 ln \ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc57,\ud835\udc61 = \u2211 \ud835\udc63\u0305\ud835\udc59,\ud835\udc57,\ud835\udc61\u2206 ln \ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc59,\ud835\udc57,\ud835\udc61 \u2212 \u2206 ln \u2211 \ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc59,\ud835\udc57,\ud835\udc61 (4.4) The first term on the right-hand side indicates the change in labour input and the second term indicates the change in total persons employed in sector \u2018j\u2019. It can easily be seen that if proportions of each labour type in the labour force change, this will have an impact on the growth of labour input beyond any change in total persons worked. The index of aggregate labour quality thus measures the changes in the composition of labour in the economy. However, the use of this method becomes more and more data intensive as we introduce more classifications of labour such as gender and age groups. Due to data limitation of sample size becoming very small as we try to estimate persons employed and earnings by industry by all the characteristics, the present study has computed labour quality index by using only education characteristic in the JGF methodology. Thus, the data required for the labour quality index in the present case, is employment and earnings by education and by industry. The labour quality index has been computed using five education categories"

    "output": "The following steps have been performed to compute the distribution of persons employed by the five educational groups for all the 27 industries for the selected major rounds of EUS and PLFS:\ni) compute the distribution of persons employed by the five educational groups namely- up to primary, primary, middle, secondary & higher secondary, and above higher secondary for all the 27 industries for the selected major rounds of EUS and PLFS.\nii) Apply these proportions to the number of employed persons in different industries in the major rounds and PLFS to obtain the distribution of persons by education groups.\niii) Estimate the earnings data from NSO which relates to mainly the regular and casual persons employed. It may however be mentioned that even for these two groups, for a large number of persons employed, the wages are either missing or given as zero. For these employed persons whose wage information is missing, a Mincer equation is used to estimate the earnings for self -employed persons, using a Mincer wage equation, which is corrected for sample selection bias by using the Heckman\u2019s two step procedure. The Mincer function has been applied to the earnings of casual and regular employees where the earnings have been regressed on the dummies of age, gender, education, location (rural or urban), marital status, social exclusion and industry. The identification factors used in the first stage are age, gender, marital status, and type of household. The corresponding earnings of the self -employed are obtained as the predicted value with similar traits. The average wages per day are then computed for persons employed of different type of employment, i.e., self-employed, regular and casual combined together; whose wages are available.\niv) Estimate labour quality index using the equations explained above, and the data compiled in steps i-iii.\nThe labour input (adjusted labour persons) then can be obtained by multiplying the number of persons employed by the corresponding labour quality index and the labour input growth is finally obtained by combining the growth of persons employed and the growth in the index of labour quality."

    "input": "Question: What are the definitions of employment used in the NSSO's employment and unemployment surveys?",
    "output": "The surveys of NSSO on employment and unemployment (EUS) aim to measure the extent of \u2018employment\u2019 and \u2018unemployment\u2019 in quantitative terms disaggregated by various household and population characteristics following the three reference periods of (i) one year, (ii) one week, and (iii) each day of the week. Based on these three reference periods, three different measures, termed as usual status, current weekly status, and the current daily status, are arrived at. While all these three approaches are used for collection of data on employment and unemployment in the quinquennial surveys, the first two approaches only are used for the purpose in the annual surveys.\n\nIn NSS 27th round, the usual principal activity category of the persons was determined by considering the normal working pattern, i.e., the activity pursued by them over a long period in the past and which was likely to continue in the future. For the identification of the usual principal status of an individual based on the major time criterion, in NSS 27th, 32nd, 38th, 43rd rounds, a trichotomous classification of the population was followed, that is, a person was classified into one of the three broad groups \u2018employed\u2019, \u2018unemployed\u2019 and \u2018out of labour force\u2019 based on the major time criterion. From NSS 50th round onwards, the procedure was changed and the prescribed procedure was a two-stage dichotomous one which involved a classification into \u2018labour force\u2019 and \u2018out labour force\u2019 in the first stage, and thereafter, the labour force into \u2018employed\u2019 and \u2018unemployed\u2019 in the second stage.\n\nIn the usual status approach, besides principal status, information in respect of subsidiary economic status of an individual was collected in all employment and unemployment surveys. For deciding the subsidiary economic status of an individual, no minimum number of days of work during the last 365 days was mentioned prior to NSS 61st round. In NSS 61st round, a minimum of 30 days of work, among other things, during the last 365 days, was considered necessary for classification as usual subsidiary economic activity of an individual.\n\nIn the EUS of NSSO, a person is considered a worker if he/she has performed any economic activity at least for one hour on any day of the reference week and uses the priority criteria in assigning work activity status. This definition is consistent with the ILO convention and used by most of the countries in the world for their labor force surveys. In NSSO, prior to NSS 50th round and in all the annual surveys till NSS 59th round, data on employment and unemployment in the CWS approach was collected by putting a single-shot question \u2018whether worked for at least one hour on any day during the last 7 days preceding the date of survey\u2019. The information so collected was used to determine the CWS of the individuals. This procedure was criticized for being not able to identify the entire workforce, particularly among the women. It was then decided to derive the CWS of a person from the time disposition of the household members for the 7 days preceding the date of survey. The procedure was used for the first time in NSS 50th round."

These are computed on the basis of the information on employment and unemployment recorded for the 14 half days of the reference week. The employment statuses during the seven days are recorded in terms of half or full intensities. An hour or more but less than four hours is taken as half intensity and four hours or more is taken as full intensity. An advantage of this approach was that it was based on more complete information; it embodied the time utilisation, and did not accord priority to labour force over outside the labour force or work over unemployment, except in marginal cases. A disadvantage was that it related to person-days, not persons, hence it had to be used with some caution."

    "output": "To calculate the data on wages for self-employed workers, a Mincer type regression equation is estimated, where wages is a function of worker characteristics (see Mincer, 1974; Heckman, 1976). This corrects for sample selection bias using Heckman\u2019s two-step procedure. In this procedure, a selection equation is first estimated to understand the selection process, using a Probit model. The selection equation explains the decision of whether to participate in the labor market. In the model the dependent variable is a dummy variable that takes the value 1 if a person is working and 0 otherwise, and the independent variables are the relevant individual characteristics of the respondents:\n\n\ud835\udc67\ud835\udc56\n\u2217 = \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc56 \u2219 \ud835\udefe\ud835\udc56 + \ud835\udc62\ud835\udc56 where \ud835\udc67\ud835\udc56 = 1 if the person i is employed and 0 otherwise. \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc57 consists of a set of identification factors, which are age, sex, marital status, and type of household or size of households. Effectively, in this regression, the effects of individual characteristics on the decision to join the labor market are estimated. The residual of this Probit regression is used to obtain information on the effect of the unmeasured characteristics that are not available in the dataset or not captured by the estimated coefficients of the explanatory variables. These residuals, which are argued to reflect the unmeasured characteristics related to employment, are used to construct a selection bias control factor in a subsequent regression.\nIn the second step, a regression analysis is performed where the dependent variable is earnings of workers and the independent variables are worker characteristics. This regression helps explain wages received by workers, observable only for those for whom the selection equation takes a value of 1.\n\n\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56 = \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56 \u2219 \ud835\udefd\ud835\udc56 + \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc56; observed only if \ud835\udc67\ud835\udc56\n\u2217 = 1.  where \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56 is the earnings of individual i, \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc57\u2019s are a set of j individual characteristics (age, sex, education, location, and marital status) and the industry in which they work. An additional independent variable is added to this equation: the residual (or what is called the inverse of Mill's ratio) from step 1, which captures the unmeasured characteristics.\n(\ud835\udc96\ud835\udc8a, \ud835\udf3a\ud835\udc8a)  \u223cbivariate normal [\ud835\udfce, \ud835\udfce, \ud835\udfcf, \ud835\udf48\ud835\udf3a [0, 0, 1, \u03c3\u03b5, \u03c1], where \u03c1 is the correlation between ei and ui. It follows that a standard regression approach would yield biased estimates when \u03c1 \u2260 0. Heckman provides consistent, asymptotically efficient estimates for all the parameters in such a model. In actual estimation, a likelihood ratio test of the independence of these equations testing for \u03c1 = 0 with the corresponding chi -squared statistic is done. This technique helps overcome the problem of not being able to observe the wage for those who are not employed in the reference period. The regression function has been used to the earnings of casual and regular employees whose wages are observed, and the selection model is used for the unobserved wages of the self -employed persons."

    "output": "This chapter outlines the methodology employed to estimate capital input for the 27 industries in the India KLEMS database version 2020. All the productivity calculations in India KLEMS use capital services as the input to production, which is estimated using the approach developed by Jorgenson and Griliches (1967), and outlined in Jorgenson, Gollop, and Fraumeni (1987). The estimation of capital service growth rates is accomplished by first estimating capital stock for different capital assets, and then aggregating across assets after correcting for the differences in their marginal productivities. The main difference between conventional measures of aggregate capital stock and the measures of capital services used in India KLEMS is that the latter accounts for the differences in marginal productivity between different asset types. While the capital stock measures, when accounted for appropriate depreciation profiles, only consider the differences in productivity between different vintages of capital, they do not account for asset heterogeneity. For instance, aggregate capital stock measures would assume that a computer's productivity is the same as that of a car. However, proper measures of capital stock would account for the decline in the efficiency of both computers and cars over their lifetime. Following an overview of the theoretical method to measure capital services (Jorgenson and Griliches,1967;JGF, 1987), the chapter discusses the specific empirical approaches we follow to implement these methods within the constraints of data availability for Indian industries."

    "input": "Question: What considerations and methodologies are employed in India KLEMS for measuring capital input, and what data sources are utilized in the construction of the database?",
    "output": "In India KLEMS, when measuring capital input, an external rate of return is used because investors make their investment decisions considering the prevailing interest rates in the economy. Ideally taxes should be included to account for differences in tax treatment of the different asset types and different legal forms (household, corporate and non-corporate), but this refinement would require data on capital tax allowances and rates by industry and year, which is beyond the scope of this database. Since the measure of capital input takes account of asset heterogeneity, it was essential to obtain investment data by asset type, distinguishing between 3 different asset types \u2013 construction, transport equipment, and machinery (includes ICT and non -ICT machinery). Multiple sources of information are used for the construction of the database on capital services, including the National Accounts Statistics (NAS), the Annual Survey of Industries (ASI), the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) rounds for unorganized manufacturing and Input -Output tables. The final estimates are fully consistent with the aggregate data obtained from the NAS, and the approach to capital measurement is consistent with international practices such as the EU KLEMS, which ensures the possibility of international comparisons. Once we have the estimates of capital stock for each asset (equation 5.3) and the growth rates of aggregate capital services using equation (5.1), we can also calculate the capital composition effect ( \u2206 ln \ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc44\ud835\udc61) - or the effect of changing asset composition of capital stock. This can be obtained as \u2206 ln \ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc44\ud835\udc61 = \u2206 ln \ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc61 \u2212 \u2206 ln \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc61, where \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc61 = \u2211 \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc58,\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc58 . These growth rates can then be indexed to the base year to obtain a capital composition index (\ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc44\ud835\udc61), i.e. \ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc44\ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc44\ud835\udc61\u22121 \u00d7 e (\u2206 ln \ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc61\u2212\u2206 ln \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc61) for t>base year, and  \ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc44\ud835\udc61 = 1 for t=base year.

    "output": "To estimate asset-wise investment for broad sectors of the economy, industry-level estimates of capital input require detailed asset-by-industry investment matrices. While NAS (National Accounts Statistics) provides information on aggregate capital formation by industry of use for nine broad sectors, more detailed data on assets and industries was collected from the CSO (Central Statistics Office), underlying the published aggregate gross fixed capital formation by the broad industry groups, separately for public and private sectors. For sectors where investment matrices were unavailable from CSO, information was gathered from other sources (e.g., ASI for organized manufacturing and NSSO surveys for unorganized manufacturing) and benchmarked to the aggregate investment series from the National Accounts. The current version of the India KLEMS data is based on the revised NAS with a 2011-2012 base, available only since 2012. For earlier years, the series is extrapolated using growth rates from the previous data version. Slight differences between industry groups in the current and previous NAS releases required some sector matching before combining the series. Investment in education and health are obtained directly from national accounts for the period after 2012, for each asset. For years before 2012, the trend in the distribution of output is assumed to split the total investment in the aggregates of these sectors into sub-sectors."

    "output": "Table 5.2 outlines the capital asset types in National Accounts Statistics and their corresponding assets in India KLEMS. For the public sector, NAS asset types include Buildings, Other construction, Transport Equipment, Machinery & Equipment, Software (1999-00 onwards), and ICT equipment (2012 onwards). The corresponding India KLEMS asset types are Construction, Construction, Transport Equipment, and Machinery & Equipment (Software and ICT equipment are included). For the private sector, NAS asset types include Residential buildings, Non-residential building, Other construction, Machinery & Equipment (incl. transport equipment), Software (1999-00 onwards), and ICT equipment (2012 onwards). The corresponding India KLEMS asset types are Construction, Construction, Construction, and Machinery & Equipment (transport equipment is excluded later, and Software and ICT equipment are included).\n\nThe asset categories are available for the period 1950-2016. After 2016, the asset groupings are limited to dwellings, other buildings & structures, machinery & equipment (including transport equipment), intellectual property, and cultivated biological resources. Detailed data on intangible investment are also available in the 2012 base NAS data for the period 2011-2016 and included in machinery assets in the KLEMS asset group. Buildings and other construction include dwellings, non-residential buildings, roads & bridges, and other construction. Software and ICT are included in the machinery and equipment. Transport equipment was not separately available for the private sector, and therefore, it was imputed and subtracted from machinery and equipment. Also, transport equipment was not separately available for both public and private sectors since 2016, and therefore, a fixed proportion of transport equipment to total machinery and equipment from 2016 was used. Total investment in each asset category is calculated as the sum of private and public sector investment in each asset. Investment in transport equipment is not available separately for the private sector, so several approaches were used to impute it."

    "output": "To estimate and adjust transport equipment investment data within the private sector, several approaches were used. Initially, the share of transport equipment in non-departmental enterprises was applied to machinery & equipment in the private sector. However, this was inconsistent with reported aggregate private sector transport equipment. A second step used the industry distribution from this series applied to published total private sector transport equipment data. However, this generated negative numbers in transport equipment, particularly in transport services. The final approach distributed the NAS total machinery in the private sector using the industry distribution of machinery and transport equipment, subtracting these estimates from total machinery & transport equipment data to obtain transport equipment investment in private sector industries for 1950-2016.\n\nSince 2016-2017, reliance was placed on publicly available National Accounts data due to lack of detailed asset/industry-wise data. As data on transport equipment was not separately available, the share of transport equipment in the total machinery and equipment group in 2016-2017 was assumed to remain constant. The nominal investment was deflated using the GFCF deflator for transport equipment.\n\nFor disaggregating manufacturing sector investment post-2016, where NAS only provided aggregate manufacturing sector data, information from the Annual Survey of Industries (ASI) and NSSO unorganized surveys were used. However, NAS stopped providing the split between registered and unregistered manufacturing since 2016. As a workaround, the household sector was considered a proxy for the unregistered sector, and the corporate and public sectors as proxies for the registered sector."

The published NAS series was considered the benchmark since 2012, and the industry distribution of the 2012-2016 detailed series obtained previously from the CSO was applied.

    "input": "Question: How does the change in aggregation procedure affect historic GFCF growth rates and capital stock growth rates, and how is asset-wise investment handled for non-NAS sectors in the India KLEMS database?",
    "output": "The change in the aggregation procedure causes some differences in the historic GFCF growth rate for the KLEMS sector j for the period 1950-2011. This difference in the GFCF growth also leads to a historical revision of capital stock growth rates for the entire series in some industries (e.g., agriculture, which is the sum of crops, fisheries, forestry; utility sector, which is the sum of electricity, gas, and water supply; transport services, which is the sum of different transport services, storage, etc.), as capital stock is a cumulative sum of investment stream over the years. While it may be accurate to use detailed industry data to extrapolate backward (the earlier approach), the magnitude of the fluctuation might affect the quality of the data. Moreover, the current approach is consistent with the approach taken for gross value added in the KLEMS database.\n\nNAS provides data only for 9 broad sectors, while the India KLEMS database has 27 industries, which necessitated further splitting of some of the NAS sectors. This includes aggregate manufacturing (registered and unregistered separately for the period 1950-2016) with 13 sub sectors; other services into 4 sub sectors; and real estate activities and business services into 2 sub sectors. The manufacturing sector investment data was disaggregated into 13 subsectors at the 2-digit level of NIC 1998 using ASI and NSSO data, which will be discussed in detail subsequently. Investment series in service sector has been split into sub sectors using two alternative approaches\u2013value added shares, and capital/labour ratio in the higher aggregate industry. However, the final data used are based on value added shares, as a sensitivity analysis did not show a significant difference between the two.\nRegistered (organized) Manufacturing: In order to split the aggregate capital formation in organized manufacturing sector into 13 study sectors, the ASI is used. However, the published data does not provide any asset wise investment information; it consists of only the aggregate capital formation or the book value of fixed capital. Most studies in the past have measured gross investment as the difference between book value of asset in period t and in period t -1 and add depreciation in period t to that. This approach has the deficiency of comparing two different samples reported in two different years, where the number of firms/factories might be different. In particular, while using this approach at industry level, for detailed asset categories, it might generate massive negative investment.\nWe follow an alternative approach, following ASI\u2019s definition of gross fixed capital formation (GFCF). ASI defines GFCF as actual additions (newly purchased, second hand and own construction) minus deductions plus depreciation adjustment for discarded assets during the year. This approach is based on a single year\u2019s sample and helps to avoid potential huge negative investment series, and is also consistent with published ASI GFCF series.\nThe yearly detailed volumes beginning 1964-65 were used to derive the gross fixed capital formation by asset type directly. For the years 1964-1978, the relevant data are obtained from published detailed volumes. For the period, 1983-84 to 2004-05 ASI has generated detailed"

    "input": "Question: How is asset-wise investment data generated for organized manufacturing sectors, and what adjustments are made for data consistency?",
    "output": "Asset-wise investment data for organized manufacturing sectors is generated using tables from Block C of the ASI schedule, which contains data on fixed assets. Data for missing years are interpolated using the changes in investment using the book value method. ASI provides investment in land, but for reasons of NAS consistency, it is excluded from the database. Once investment in each of these assets and industries is generated using ASI data, this industry-asset distribution is applied to the published aggregate NAS GFCF series for the organized manufacturing sector.\n\nFrom 1960-61 to 1971-72, ASI data are for the census sector, and from 1973-74 onwards, they are for the factory sector. To make these two series comparable over years, the data prior to 1972 is converted to the factory sector using the factory/census ratio in 1973. After these adjustments, investment data is obtained for 13 manufacturing sectors, by asset types, consistent with the NAS aggregate for registered manufacturing. This approach was accurate for the period 1950-2016 when the NAS provided aggregate registered manufacturing GFCF data. For the years after 2016, since NAS does not provide a registered manufacturing aggregate, registered manufacturing is proxied by the sum of the public sector and corporate sector."

    "output": "Investment price deflators are derived from CSO data, which provides investment data by industries and assets in both current and constant prices, with a base year of 2011-2012. For years before 2011, prices are spliced using 2004-2005 base investment deflators. These deflators are directly used for all three asset categories. If asset-wise data is unavailable for certain years (e.g., transport equipment in 2017-2018), trends from NAS data are used to extrapolate the investment price. Capital stock is constructed using the perpetual inventory method (PIM), which defines capital stock as a weighted sum of past investments. This method requires data on current investment by asset types, investment prices by asset types, and depreciation rates. Additionally, an estimate of initial benchmark stock is necessary. NAS estimates of real net capital stock in 1950 (for non-manufacturing) and 1964 (for manufacturing) are used as benchmark stock. The industry-asset distribution of GFCF is used to create net fixed capital stock estimates by asset type for all 27 sectors. The approach to split asset-wise capital stock was changed in the 2020 version of the India KLEMS database, using the distribution of net capital stock by assets, available from detailed asset data obtained from the CSO. Depreciation rates for non-ICT assets are derived from NAS estimates of asset lifetimes, using a double declining balance rate, and capital stock series are built by asset types for all 27 industries using GFCF series from 1950 (or 1964) onwards."

Assuming that the flow of capital services is proportional to the capital stock at individual asset level, aggregate capital flows can be obtained using a translog quantity index by weighting growth in the stock of each asset by the average shares of each asset in the value of capital compensation, as in (5.1). The rate of return (i) in equation (5.4) represents the opportunity cost of capital, and can be measured either as internal (or ex post) rate of return, or as an external (ex ante) rate of return. The database uses an external rate of return, proxied by the average of return on government securities and the prime lending rate obtained from the Reserve Bank of India. A real rate, net of capital gain, is used. Hence, the capital gain component in equation (5.4) is excluded while estimating rental price using the external rate of return, obtaining  \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc58,\ud835\udc61/\ud835\udc3e = \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc58,\ud835\udc61\u22121/\ud835\udc3c \u2219 \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc61 + \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc58,\ud835\udc61/\ud835\udc3c \u2219 \ud835\udeff\ud835\udc58 (5.5), where r is the real rate of return, nominal interest rate adjusted for the consumer price inflation rate.

    "output": "The National Accounts Statistics (NAS) now provides estimates of intangible capital such as intellectual property and research and development (R&D), which may be a useful extension to the capital input database. Two additional challenges are arising since the new system of national accounts. The first is the lack of separate data on registered and unregistered manufacturing, which poses challenges in using ASI and NSSO data to split aggregate manufacturing data into 13 industry groups. Instead of the registered and unregistered split, CSO now provides a division between the household and corporate sectors. This challenge is addressed by considering the household sector as unregistered manufacturing and the sum of public and corporate sectors as a registered sector. The second challenge is the lack of separate data on transport equipment and machinery assets in the new series of national accounts, which follows United Nation's System of National Accounts (SNA)-2008. For the time being, ad-hoc approaches are adopted to fix this, but it might necessitate combining transport equipment and machinery to one single asset on a long -term basis. Finally, the debate on whether it is appropriate to use an external rate of return or an internal rate of return is unsettled in the literature, and it may be worth exploring estimates of capital using the internal rate of return. The current version of the database uses an external rate of return, proxied by average of return on government securities and prime lending rate obtained from the Reserve Bank of India."

    "output": "The basic approach used to derive the volume series of Intermediate Inputs namely \u2013Energy input (E), Material input (M) and Services input (S). This breakdown of intermediate inputs can be used for extending the growth accounting exercises, but also convey interesting information about changing pattern in intermediate consumption. The methodology for measuring industry output, intermediate inputs and value added was developed by Jorgenson, Gallop and Fraumeni (1987) and extended by Jorgenson (1990 a). The cornerstone of this approach is a time series of input output (IO) tables which gives the flows of all commodities in the economy, as well as payments to primary factors. Every commodity is accounted for, whether produced by a domestic source or imported, and every use is noted, whether purchased by an industry or by a final demand element. All payments to factors of production i.e., labour and capital is accounted for so that all income elements of GDP are included. The methodology of constructing time series on energy, material and services inputs for the European economy has been elucidated in Timmer et al. (2010, Chapter 3). Following a similar approach as explained in Jorgenson et al. (2005, Chapter 4) and Timmer et al. (2010, Chapter 3), the time series on intermediate inputs for the India KLEMS project have been constructed. As in EU KLEMS, this study identifies three main categories of Intermediate inputs: Energy Input, Material Input and Service Input. Intermediate Inputs are broken down into energy, material and services, based on input output transaction tables using a standard NIC product classification. The following five energy types (and products) have been classified as the Energy input: Coal and Lignite, Petroleum products, Electricity (for electricity used in the electricity sector, since there is a good amount of inter-firm sale and purchase of electricity, it has been treated as material rather than as energy), Natural gas, and Gas (LPG)."

Storage and warehousing\n5. Communication\n6. Trade\n7. Hotels and restaurants\n8. Banking\n9. Insurance\n10. Ownership of dwellings\n11. Education and research\n12. Medical and health\n13. Other services\n14. Public administration\nAll other intermediate inputs barring the above mentioned nineteen inputs are classified as material input.\nThe key building block for constructing time series on Intermediate Inputs at current prices, as explained in Jorgenson et al. (2005, Chapter 4), is the input -output transaction tables, that is, the inter industry transaction tables that provide a description of which industries produce each product and which industries use them. The input -output table gives the inter -industry transactions in value terms at factor cost presented in the form of commodity x industry matrix where the columns represent the industries and the rows as group of commodities, which are the principal products of the corresponding industries. Each row of the matrix shows in the relevant columns, the deliveries of the total output of the commodities to the different industries for intermediate consumption and final use. The entries read down industry columns give the commodity inputs of raw -materials and services, which are used to produce outputs of particular industries. The column entries at the bottom of the table give net indirect taxes (NIT) (indirect taxes \u2013 subsidies) on the inputs and the primary inputs (income from use of labour and capital), i.e., Gross Value Added (GVA). As the IOTT is in the form of commodity x industry matrix, the row totals do not tally with the column totals. The difference between each column and the corresponding row totals is due to the inclusion of the secondary products, which appear particularly in the case of manufacturing industries. This is so because by -products are also manufactured by industries in addition to their main products. Thus, while determining the entries in the rows, a by -product of an industry is transferred to the sector (commodity row), whose principal product is the same as the by -product under reference. The columns, however, show the total of principal products and by -products of each industry. All the entries in the IOTT are at factor cost, i.e., excluding trade and transport charges and NIT."

For the industry group \u2018Coke, Refined Petroleum and Nuclear Fuel\u2019, proportions are estimated from ASI data instead of Input Output Transaction Table. In IOTT, no intermediate input is being used in industry 24 \u2013 \u2018Public Administration\u2019. Consequently, the intermediate input series is being directly estimated for only 26 industries from 1980 to 2018. However, \u2018Net Purchase of Commodities and Services\u2019 of Administrative Department is used as total intermediate input, and information about \u2018Government Final Consumption Expenditure\u2019 is used to distribute the total intermediate input into material, energy and services input."

    "input": "Question: How is the intermediate input vector projected using IOTT made consistent with the estimated output from NAS, and what steps are involved in this process?",
    "output": "The projection of the intermediate input vector, using IOTT in Step 3, needs to be consistent with the estimated output from NAS. This involves several steps. First, the Gross Value of Output and the Gross Value Added at current prices calculated from NAS is taken. The difference between GVO and GVA provides the gap between value added and gross output for each year, reflecting the Total Intermediate inputs from NAS (GVO-GVA). The intermediate input vector projected using IOTT will likely not align with the estimates of Total Intermediate inputs from NAS. Thus, the projected input vector is proportionately adjusted to match the gap between value added and gross output obtained from NAS. This adjustment involves two steps: 1. For Benchmark years: The ratio of Total Intermediate inputs from NAS to that from IOTT is adjusted proportionately to the absolute value of Energy Inputs/Material Inputs/Service Inputs obtained from IOTT. 2. For Intervening Years: The interpolated proportions of Energy Inputs, Material Inputs, and Services Inputs obtained from IOTT are applied directly to the total intermediate inputs from NAS to get each input's share. An example provided uses the Construction sector with adjustment A for IOTT Benchmark Year 1998, showcasing how the absolute values of inputs from IOTT are adjusted by the ratio of Total Input from NAS to Total Input from IOTT to align the figures."

    "output": "Deflators are obtained for each of the 115 (IOTT 1989 and 1998) and 130 (IOTT 2007) commodity inputs. In several cases, if no proper WPI is available for the sector, the best available is chosen; in some cases, the right index is formed from item level indices, or one index is removed from a higher-level aggregate to generate the right index. For electricity, the right price is chosen depending on the nature of economic activity (e.g., industry price for manufacturing). For service inputs, implicit GDP deflators from NAS are used since WPI is not available. Deflators obtained for different IO sectors are combined using weights based on the column of the relevant study industry in the IO table, allowing for changing weights over time using three IOTTs (1989, 1998, and 2007) for different time periods. The deflators for Material, Energy and Service Inputs for each study industry have been used to deflate the Current price Intermediate Input series to Constant price. Gross Value Added for Agriculture estimated by NAS using double deflated method. Therefore, for the Agriculture sector the deflated value of intermediate input is adjusted to the gap between value added and gross output at constant price. Thus, we have a time series of Material, Energy and Service Inputs for 27 study Industries at constant prices."

    "output": "The distribution of income between capital, labour and intermediate inputs, is an important element in growth accounting because income shares, under conditions of competitive markets, can be used to measure the contributions each factor makes towards output growth. Under the assumption of constant returns to scale with two factors of production i.e., labour and capital, the sum of the labour income share and capital income share is 1. The labour income share is defined as the ratio of labour income to GVA. Capital income share is accordingly obtained as one minus labour income share.\n\nThere are no published data on factor income shares in Indian economy at a detailed disaggregate level. National Accounts Statistics (NAS) of the CSO publishes the NDP series comprising of compensation of employees (CE), operating surplus (OS) and mixed income (MI) for the NAS industries. The income of the self -employed persons, i.e., mixed income (MI) is not separated in to the labour component and capital component of the income. Therefore, to compute the labour income share out of value added, one has to take the sum of the compensation of employees and that part of the mixed income which are wages for labour.\n\nThe computation of labour income share for the 27 study industries involves two steps. First, estimates of CE, OS and MI have to be obtained for each of the 27 study industries from the NAS data which are available only for the NAS sectors (see Table 7.1). Second, the estimate of mixed income has to be split into labour income and capital income for each industry for each year (except for those industries for which the reported mixed income is zero, for instance, public administration)."

These data sources are used to obtain estimates of CE, OS and MI for each of the 27 study industries. For splitting the labour and non -labour components out of the mixed income of self -employed, the unit level data of NSS employment-unemployment survey are used along with the estimates of CE, OS and MI basically obtained from the NAS.\n\nThe estimation of labour income share for the 27 study industries has been done in two steps: Step 1 involves estimating CE, OS, and MI for the 27 study industries using NAS data. For the period 1980-81 to 2011-12, CE, OS, and MI series are proportionally adjusted to align with updated GVA estimates. For some industries, data is readily available from NAS, while for others, estimates are distributed across study industries proportionally based on gross value added. For manufacturing industries before 2011-12, NAS provides estimates for registered and unregistered manufacturing, which are then split into 13 manufacturing industries using ASI data, distributing CE and OS based on emoluments and gross value added."

For unregistered manufacturing and household sectors, a similar methodology is applied, utilizing published results and unit-level data from surveys of unorganized manufacturing industries. Specifically, estimates of wage payments to hired workers in different industries are used to proportionally split the estimate of CE (Compensation of Employees) in the NAS for aggregate unregistered manufacturing. The estimated wage payment is subtracted from the estimated value added to obtain an estimate of capital income and mixed income of the self-employed in various unorganized manufacturing industries.

    "output": "The value of \ud835\udf02, representing the labour income proportion in income, is obtained by averaging the estimates from two distinct approaches. The first approach estimates the labour income of self-employed workers for each study industry over eight years (1983-84, 1987-88, 1993-94, 1999-00, 2004-05, 2009-10, 2011-12, and 2015-16) using NSS employment-unemployment survey data to determine the number of self-employed, their wage rates, and working days. This data provides an annual labor income estimate, which, when divided by the mixed income of self-employed (from NAS data), yields an estimate of \ud835\udf02. This ratio is computed directly for five industries and for 11 industry groups, with a common ratio applied to constituent industries within those groups.\n\nThe second approach uses NSS data to compute \ud835\udf03, the ratio of labour income of self-employed workers to the labour income of regular and casual workers. The CE (Compensation of Employees) provided in the NAS is then multiplied by \ud835\udf03 to estimate the labour income component out of the MI (Mixed Income) reported in the NAS. The labor component of MI divided by total MI gives an estimate of \ud835\udf02. If the estimated labour component of MI exceeds the estimate of MI, the estimate of \ud835\udf02 is taken as unity. Finally, the method adopted involves computing the average value of \ud835\udf02 for each industry or industry group using estimates for the years 1983-84, 1987-88, 1993-94, 1999-00, 2004-05, 2009-10, 2011-12 and 2015-16, separately for estimates based on both approach -1 and approach -2.

    "output": "This chapter deals with the methodology of measurement of total factor productivity (TFP) growth for individual industries in the KLEMS framework and the aggregation from industry level productivity measures to measures for broad sectors and the economy as a whole. The methodology of analysis of sources of gross output growth at the individual industry level and sources of GVA (Gross Value Added) or GDP growth at the broad sector level and economy level will also be presented in this chapter. Our measurement of TFP growth for different industries of the Indian economy is based on a gross output production function for each industry j: Y = f(L(L1,\u2026Ln), K(K1\u2026Km), E(E1\u2026.Es), M(M1 \u2026Mu), S(S1 \u2026 Sv ), T) where Y is industry gross output, L is labor input, K is capital input and E, M and S are intermediate inputs-namely energy, material and services and T is an indicator of technology for industry j. All variables are indexed by time (t subscript is suppressed). There are several things to note about the production function  - (1) all variables are aggregates of many components that have been discussed in the earlier report/chapters;  (2) we assume that the industry production function is separable in these aggregates; (3) time (indicator of technology) enters the production function symmetrically and directly with inputs. An important feature of the gross output approach is the explicit role of intermediate inputs. In our study, we have considered three intermediate inputs - energy, material and services and this is important as we may find that intermediate inputs are the primary component of some industries outputs. Failure to quantify intermediate inputs leads us to miss both the role of key industries that produce intermediate inputs and the importance of intermediate inputs for the industries that use them. In order to estimate the production function at constant prices, the industry level price data is used for output, capital, labor and intermediate inputs, e.g., PYj; PLj, PKj; PEj. PMj, PSj. We assume that all industries face the same input price. The industry price of an input varies across industries due to compositional effects as industries expend different shares of their investment on each type of asset. The same is true for all inputs."

    "output": "Z is the stock of industry capital, Qk is the capital quality, H is the number of persons employed, and Ql is the quality of labor. For aggregation across industries, the T\u00f6rnqvist index is applied to estimate TFP growth for each year during 1980-81 to 2018-19, yielding an index of TFP for each industry. However, the method of estimation of TFP growth for individual industries described in section 8.1 cannot be readily applied to a higher level of aggregation.  The main problem is that gross value of output cannot be added across industries to generate a measure of output at a higher level of aggregation. It becomes necessary therefore to consider appropriate methods of aggregation across industries consistent with the gross output function specification of technology at the individual industry level. One has to use the concept of value added to define an appropriate measure of output at the economy or broad sector level."

    "input": "Question: What are the two approaches to aggregation, and how do they differ in their assumptions regarding the value-added function and the price of value added across industries?",
    "output": "There are two approaches to aggregation: the aggregate production function approach and the aggregate production possibility frontier approach. Both approaches need the separability condition described in equations 8.8 and 8.9. The main difference is that the aggregate production possibility frontier approach relaxes the assumption that all industries must face the same value added function. Thus, the price of value added is no longer assumed to be the same across industries. The implication is that the aggregate value added from the aggregate production possibility frontier is given by the T\u00f6rnqvist index of the industry value added as: \u2206 ln \ud835\udc49 = \u2211 \ud835\udc64\u0305\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 \u2206\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc49\ud835\udc56 (8.11). In this equation, wi is the share of industry i in aggregate value added in nominal terms. Thus, defining P V,i as the price of value added in industry i and V i as the real value added in industry i, the share in question may be defined as: \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc56 = (\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc49,\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc49\ud835\udc56) / (\u2211 \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc49,\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc49\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57), (8.12) and the two-period average is defined as: \ud835\udc64\u0305\ud835\udc56 = 0.5 \u2217 (\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc61 + \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc61\u22121) (8.13). Since each industry is subject to a production function separable in capital, labour and technology, as defined in equation 8.9, real gross output, real value of intermediate inputs and real value added of industry i in a particular year t should satisfy the following relationship: \u2206 ln \ud835\udc4c\ud835\udc56 = \ud835\udc62\u0305\ud835\udc49,\ud835\udc56\u2206\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc49\ud835\udc56 + \ud835\udc62\u0305\ud835\udc4b,\ud835\udc56\u2206\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc56 (8.14). In this equation, uV and uX are the shares of value added and intermediate inputs in the gross value of output in nominal terms. Given data on growth in gross output and growth in intermediate input of a particular industry, the above equation yields the growth in real value added of that industry. TFP growth from the aggregate production possibility frontier may be defined as follows."

    "output": "TFP growth (\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc47) can be calculated using the equation \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc47 = \u2206\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc49 \u2212 \ud835\udc63\u0305\ud835\udc3e\u2206\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc3e \u2212 \ud835\udc63\u0305\ud835\udc3f\u2206\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc3f, where K and L are aggregate capital input and labor input, respectively, and vK and vL are value shares of capital and labor. This assumes each type of capital and labor has the same price across industries, allowing for aggregation using a T\u00f6rnqvist index. Alternatively, industry-level capital input growth can be combined using a T\u00f6rnqvist index to obtain aggregate capital input growth, with a similar approach for labor.\n\nThe third approach to measuring the TFP index at an aggregate level is to apply direct aggregation to industry level estimates, maintaining industry level production accounts as the fundamental building block.

    "input": "Question: How are aggregate level estimates of TFPG obtained, and what approach is used in the India KLEMS dataset for the manufacturing and services sectors?",
    "output": "Turning now to the aggregate level estimates of TFPG, the three alternate approaches to aggregation described in Section 8.2 above, drawing on Jorgenson et al. (2005), are applicable to economy level aggregation, but these are not readily applicable to intermediate level of aggregation, for instance, aggregation to the level of the manufacturing sector. In the India KLEMS dataset, aggregate level real GVA growth, labour input growth, capital input growth and TFP growth based on the value added function framework have been provided for the aggregate economy and for the manufacturing sector and the services sector. Of the three approaches to aggregation discussed in Section 8.2 above, the third approach which involves application of Domar weights is relatively superior as it makes least restrictive assumptions among the three approaches. However, the manner of constructing applicable Domar weights for obtaining the TFPG estimates for the manufacturing sector aggregate and the services sector aggregate differ from those applicable for making economy level TFPG estimates. In order to ensure that the estimates of TFPG obtained for the manufacturing sector and the services sector (and provided in the India KLEMS dataset) are comparable to those for the aggregate economy, a rather simple approach has been taken. This approach is based on application of the T\u00f6rnqvist index for the purpose of computing the growth rates in real GVA, labour input and capital input and deriving the TFP growth rate accordingly, based on the value added function framework. Taking this approach, computations are made for the manufacturing sector and the services sector, and for the aggregate economy. The simple approach that has been taken does not have as good a conceptual basis as the three approaches described in the previous section particularly the approach of direct aggregation, but it has the advantage of easy implementation and comparability of estimates. The methodology that has been applied to obtain TFPG for the manufacturing sector and services sector and the economy is spelt out further in what follows. In the India KLEMS database, simple Tornquvist aggregates of TFP growth rates for broad sectors and the aggregate economy are provided, obtained using a Tornqvist aggregate of growth rates of real value added, capital input, and labour input."

The strategy provided a pathway to accelerate financial inclusion to promote economic wellbeing, prosperity, and sustainable development in the country. The strategy was prepared based on consultations and suggestions from the Government of India, other Financial Sector Regulators namely, Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI), and Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority of India (PFRDA) as also the specialised institutions and market participants, namely, National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD), National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), Commercial Banks, etc. Anchored to the country\u2019s development priorities, the strategy sought to address the inherent barriers in access to formal financial products and services. It recognised that an inclusive financial system, ably supported through sound financial inclusion policies with focus on financial education and customer protection, is not only pro-growth but also pro-poor. Further, it has the potential to reduce income inequality and poverty, promote social cohesion and shared economic development. NSFI underscored that financial exclusion leaves the disadvantaged and low - income segments of society with no choice other than informal options, making them vulnerable to financial distress, debt, and poverty, and ultimately leading to several multi -dimensional physical, socio -cultural, and psychological barriers and deprivations. Hence, it warranted attention from the policy makers for effective action. NSFI concurred with the widely available empirical evidence on how financial inclusion has a multiplier effect in boosting overall economic output and reducing poverty and income inequality at the national level. It emphasised that financial inclusion of women is particularly important for gender equality and women\u2019s economic empowerment. With greater control over their financial lives, women can help themselves and their families to come out of poverty, reduce their risk of falling into poverty."

The Financial Inclusion Index (FI-Index) and its sub-indices (Access, Usage, and Quality) also show a consistent growth over the period of 5 years with improvements seen across all the sub-indices. In 2024, the major growth in the index was on account of the usage sub-index, indicating deepening of financial inclusion. The dip in the quality sub-index in 2021 was due to the reduced number of financial literacy activities because of lockdown restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic."

    "output": "The COVID-19 pandemic induced an unforeseen global socio-economic distress and caused loss of lives and livelihood with substantial spill overs. This created an extraordinary challenge for the governments and policymakers to implement appropriate relief, restoration, and stimulus package to minimise and absorb the pandemic induced hardships.\n\nGovernment of India, State Governments, Reserve Bank of India and other relevant stakeholders took numerous steps to leverage the last mile reach of the FI ecosystem and digital transactions in furthering and deepening the financial inclusion efforts, especially through Digital Public Infrastructures (DPI) in a cost-effective and innovative manner. To mitigate the adverse impact of COVID-19 pandemic, the Government of India was able to smoothly deliver an amount of \u20b95.53 lakh crore digitally across 319 government schemes spread over 54 ministries during 2020-21 under the PM Garib Kalyan Yojana, using DPI.\n\nThe Business Correspondent (BC) Model emerged as a critical lifeline in disbursing such benefits to the doorstep of the people, especially in rural areas of the country. During the pandemic, ICT-BC transaction routed through BC outlets witnessed a significant surge crossing more than 94 crore transactions accounting for \u20b92.25 lakh crore during 2020-21.\n\nRBI in its pursuit to support digital financial services enhanced limit for additional factor of authentication (AFA) per transaction for card transactions in contactless mode at Points of Sale (PoS) terminals , while actively promoting use of digital payments . Further, to alleviate stress amongst small borrowers, RBI undertook measures, namely, grant of moratorium on consumer term loan for a period of six months (March 1, 2020 \u2013 August 31, 2020), deferment of interest on working capital facilities in the form of cash credit/overdraft, easing of working capital financing , and facilitating financial institutions to resolve stressed loans to individuals, small business and MSMEs, besides several relaxations in priority sector lending.\n\nSince the pandemic created hurdles in delivering financial literacy to the masses through physical modes, Regional Offices (ROs) of the Bank explored innovative approaches to promote financial literacy amongst the masses, such as Community Radio Channels, Local TV Channels and Local FM stations to impart the financial education in regional languages/local dialects. On its part, SEBI adopted virtual mode to reach out to investors across the country covering over one lakh participants through investor awareness programmes conducted by exchanges, depositories, and SEBI recognised investor associations and trainers."

    "instruction": "Answer the question based on the provided context from the financial report.",
    "input": "Question: What are the supply and demand side impediments to financial inclusion?",
    "output": "Financial inclusion initiatives start from the supply side of financial services whereby the availability of financial services in terms of access points, products, etc. is ensured. Availability of adequate supply infrastructure for financial services in terms of well-functioning access points, physical or digital interfaces, suitable products, and services, etc., is necessary though not a sufficient condition for effective financial inclusion, as demand for financial services also plays a crucial role in effectiveness of financial inclusion initiatives. Hence, both supply and demand aspects of financial inclusion should be paid adequate attention to, while formulating financial inclusion strategies. Amongst the key supply side challenges, the quality and effectiveness of last mile reach to the financial services remains the most important element. On the other hand, demand side issues are conditioned by several factors in the usage and quality dimension of financial inclusion. The first set of challenges to the demand for financial services stem from information asymmetry, lack of proper knowhow about availability, cost, and use of financial services, and at times, inability to understand and comprehend the information due to language or literacy barriers. Secondly, behavioural factors, such as personality traits, experiential factors, bounded rationality, and impulsive actions also play a role in catalyzing or dampening the usage of financial services. Behaviourally, the perceived need for financial services, and trust in the system are the two most crucial determinants of the demand side of financial inclusion. If people trust that it is in their benefit to use formal financial services, they will seek access and ensure usage, provided the services are suitably and conveniently made available in an affordable manner. Another critical demand-side impediment to financial inclusion falls in the domain of financial constraints, which either sway away people from the banking system or their usage remains very low. The effectiveness of customer protection and grievance redressal measures remains at the core of the demand for financial services, especially for the underprivileged and vulnerable segments of the population. Moreover, the ecosystem gaps, namely, inefficient , or broken linkages between various initiatives , and gaps in market access coupled with funding constraints could dampen the demand side of financial inclusion."

    "output": "The success in financial inclusion initiatives requires multi-stakeholder contribution in all its dimensions, namely, access, usage, and quality. To be effective, financial inclusion policies should focus on strengthening supply initiatives in the financial sector in terms of easy and trustworthy availability of access points, minimum cost of services, suitable products, financial literacy and proper flow of information, and an effective grievance redressal mechanism. They should also adequately focus on understanding and mitigating demand side impediments and improving the enablers in both supply and demand dimensions. The National Strategy for Financial Inclusion (NSFI: 2019-24) highlighted the need for periodic evaluation of the state of financial inclusion through monitoring of financial inclusion parameters to provide policy makers and stakeholders with necessary insights to understand the achievements made and to address issues and challenges through a coordinated approach. NSFI also underlined that in addition to data collected from financial service providers (supply-side data), there is also a need to seek views and insights from the customers (demand -side insights) at periodic intervals. Accordingly, specific studies and surveys were undertaken by the Reserve Bank to understand the ground level issues and impediments, in both demand and supply dimensions."

    "output": "An assessment of supply side impediments, especially from the angle of last mile access reveals that the last mile reach of financial services being carried out by business correspondents (BC) requires improvements. An all -India survey was conducted by the Bank on the operations of BCs during January-March 2024 through its Regional Offices across the country. About 63% of BCs covered by the survey were in rural areas, 23% in semi-urban areas, and 14% in urban areas. The survey covering 13274 BC outlets in 31 States/UTs involving 154 districts with a greater weightage to aspirational districts, revealed several areas of concerns, which require corrective measures, including the presence of a significant number of non-dedicated outlets in the BC ecosystem, a lack of standardization in the services offered by BCs, a skewed distribution of BCs in many places, insufficient and lack of timely remuneration, agents simultaneously working for multiple banks, and a majority of BCs not displaying fees levied for services. In addition, a lack of a standardised mandatory transaction confirmation SMS or audio-based confirmation, the quality of services rendered by BC outlets, service quality impacted by connectivity issues, operational difficulties, limited inter -operability, and unscrupulous practices also contribute to impediments. To assess the demand side impediments to financial inclusion at a disaggregated level with demographic details, an all-India survey was conducted during March-April 2024 with 9,147 respondents spread across 34 States/Union Territories of the country. Key observations of the survey include a key demand side impediment to account ownership/usage being lack of source of deposit to bank account, and besides income, a preference for cash, lack of knowledge, or family members having an account emerged as common impediments to bank account ownership and usage for relatively lower income groups."

    "output": "Based on an all-India survey conducted during March-April 2024, the following key observations were made regarding demand side impediments to financial inclusion:\n\n(c) Non-usage of bank accounts due to lack of regular source of deposit was more dominant for male respondents and was more pronounced in other than semi-urban areas. In case of semi-urban areas, banking fee/charges were reported as major impediments. People\u2019s trust in banks to save money was more pronounced in rural areas. The level of education helped in strengthening trust and retaining customer relationship in the formal financial system. Generally, people with lower education were relatively unable or unwilling to save through banking channels.\n\n(d) Usage of BC outlets was higher in rural/semi-urban areas as compared to urban areas, especially for female respondents vis-\u00e0-vis male respondents. The study shows that as one moves up the hierarchy in terms of income and education levels, the preference for transacting through branch or BC mode diminishes and preference for digital transactions enhances. However, transactions at ATMs seem to be not impacted by income or education levels. Hence, income and education emerge as a couple of key demand side determinants of the choice of access points and mode of transactions.\n\n(e) Preference for digital transactions was seen conditioned by gender, education, and income levels. Male respondents and people form higher income groups had higher preference for digital transactions. Having a smartphone did not necessarily translate as a fillip for digital transactions as several respondents felt dissuaded from undertaking digital transactions due to connectivity issues, complex interfaces, language barrier and concerns regarding breach of OTP/PIN, etc.\n\n(a) In the household segment, personal loans, education loans, and home loans were the top three credit facilities in demand, yet about 50 percent of aspirants had unmet credit needs. Lack of awareness about the procedure, unavailability of nearby bank branch, and lack of collateral were cited as top three impediments in that order, for inability to get credit. Interestingly, high cost (interest rate) of credit was the least cited impediment.\n\n(b) Around 16 per cent of the respondents used informal sources of credit mostly for small ticket loans, with its share being higher in rural areas. In general, people may have relied upon informal sources of credit due to ease, timeliness, and convenient access."

    "output": "Income and education levels emerged as key enablers for better usage of insurance and pension facilities. While female respondents lagged their male counterparts in access to life insurance, they had an edge in non-life insurance, indicating a possibility of gradually increasing asset ownership by females. Among the respondents who did not have any insurance/pension product, the awareness about the need for insurance and pension products was found to be low. In general, awareness about schemes like PMSBY, PMJJBY, PMFBY, and APY ranged between 30-35%. However, the respondents who knew some beneficiary of insurance claim were generally more likely to opt for it."

    "output": "The vision of NSFI (2025-30) is to create an inclusive financial system towards the wellbeing of people. Financial inclusion initiatives generally begin with supply initiatives to provide affordable, easy, trusted, and fair access to regulated financial services, namely, savings, payments, investments, credit, remittances, insurance, and pension to hitherto excluded and marginalized segments of society. Though financial inclusion falls within the ambit of the financial sector, financial inclusion policies have far and wide positive impacts and correlations in the socioeconomic domain. Financial inclusion is referenced in the targets of eight out of the seventeen United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), namely, SDG-1 on eradicating poverty, SDG-2 on ending hunger, achieving food security, and promoting sustainable agriculture, SDG-3 on promoting health and well-being, SDG-5 on achieving gender equality and economic empowerment of women, SDG-8 on promoting economic growth and jobs, SDG-9 on supporting industry, innovation and infrastructure, SDG-10 on reducing inequality, and SDG-17 on strengthening the means of implementation. Financial inclusion being an aspirational journey starts from creating opportunities for access to the formal financial system for the hitherto excluded and underserved segments, but its mandate goes beyond access to ensure effective usage of financial services to the benefit of people. Effective usage requires that people have an economic case for using the formal financial services which primarily comes from their capacity to have regular income/cash flow through employment, livelihood, etc., and have a perceptible economic incentive for using formal financial services. The sustenance and growth of usage also require continued trust of the people, suitability of products and services, sound financial literacy, a pro-active/quick grievance redressal mechanism, and a positive perception of being heard, which are some of the quality aspects of financial inclusion. Seen in the above context and in accordance with the role of financial inclusion in the achievement of sustainable development goals, it is obvious that financial inclusion is not just an end in itself but a means to a greater end of ensuring the overall wellbeing of people."

    "input": "Question: How is financial inclusion defined and what are its aims according to various committees and the NSFI?",
    "output": "The Committee on Financial Inclusion (Chairman: Dr C Rangarajan, RBI, 2008) defined financial inclusion as \u201cthe process of ensuring access to financial services, timely and adequate credit for vulnerable groups such as weaker sections and low -income groups at an affordable cost\u201d. Further, the Committee on Medium -Term Path to Financial Inclusion (Chairman: Shri Deepak Mohanty, RBI, 2015) viewed financial inclusion as, \u201cconvenient access to a basket of basic formal financial products and services that should include savings, remittance, credit, government -supported insurance and pension products to small and marginal farmers and low income households at reasonable cost with adequate protection progressively supplemented by social cash transfers, besides increasing the access of small and marginal enterprises to formal finance with a greater reliance on technology to cut costs and improve service delivery.\u201d The NSFI (2019 -24) aimed at broadening, deepening, and accelerating financial inclusion alongside promoting financial literacy and consumer protection, with a view to promoting economic wellbeing, prosperity, and sustainable development. Continuing the journey and leveraging the substantial gains during the last decade in the bank account ownership to near saturation, robust expansion in physical and digital access infrastructure, and improvements in customer awareness and protection measures, it is desirable to upscale the focus of financial inclusion by adopting a synergistic ecosystem approach . This would ensure integrated and seamless involvement of stakeholders for developing a truly inclusive financial system towards wellbeing of people by minimization of inequality of opportunities for people to reap the benefits of access to formal financial system, while substantially improving the quality and consistency of last mile reach. Financial inclusion policies duly integrated with livelihood support, market linkages, financial education, and customer protection initiatives are great enablers of an improved state of the economic wellbeing of people. Pursued holistically, financial inclusion can lead to desirable outcomes in form of a quadrangle of financial safety, financial security, financial resilience, and financial discipline, in turn contributing towards overall wellbeing of people."

    "output": "Digital financial services operating on the backbone of Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) have provided a significant fillip to financial inclusion initiatives across a wide spectrum ranging from account ownership, social benefit transfers, quicker and efficient remittances/payments, and access to credit. DPI, as interoperable, open, and inclusive systems supported by technology, serves to provide essential public and private services for the common good. The India Stack exemplifies this approach, combining digital ID, interoperable payments, a digital credentials ledger, and account aggregation framework. By leveraging the gains made, there is scope for further expanding the digital footprints for discharge of a range of financial services.\n\nIt is recommended to improve the equity, reach, consistency, and quality of last mile access by strengthening the network of business correspondents and expanding the delivery of safe and cost-effective digital financial services at the last mile.\n\nTo bring about substantial improvements in the equity, reach, consistency, and quality of last mile access to financial services, there is a need to ensure availability of at least one banking outlet \u2013 branch /digital banking unit (DBU)/ fixed point business correspondent outlet (FBC) working for a minimum of 4 hours per day for at least five days a week in each revenue centre, so that financial services are fairly and equitably available across the depth and breadth of the country. A revenue Centre is defined as the revenue unit classified and delineated by the respective State Government, i.e., a revenue village/ city/ town/ municipality/ municipal corporation, etc., as the case may be. Based on the size of the population, a revenue centre is classified into rural (population less than 10,000), semi-urban (10,000 and above and less than 1 lakh), urban (1 lakh and above and less than 10 lakhs), or metropolitan (10 lakhs and above). Such outlets, under adequate control and oversight of banks, are expected to provide a range of financial services."

    "output": "SLBCs/UTLBCs should put in place an action plan and allocate goals to banks in a phased manner to achieve the action point during the period of the strategy, with suitable mid-term goals. This will support the minimum standard set of financial services, namely, deposits, withdrawals, remittances, account opening and servicing, Jan Suraksha Schemes, loan leads/applications, pension schemes, etc., building on the progress where access to some form of banking services has been provided to 99.9 per cent of the targeted villages within 5 KM radius/ hamlets with 500 households in hilly areas.\n\nTo improve the availability and consistency of last mile access in hilly and rural areas, especially given inadequacies of bank branches in the north eastern (NE)/ hilly states, and rural areas where banking services are mostly dependent upon the BC outlets, the existing scheme of incentives, under Financial Inclusion Fund (FIF), to BCs operating in Tier V & Tier VI centres in NE States and other Hilly States /UTs (Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Ladakh & Uttarakhand) may be extended in a calibrated manner to all Fixed-Point BCs operating in Tier VI centres. This addresses the fact that the distribution of FBCs, especially in the NE region is skewed with only 165 FBCs per thousand square kilometres vis -\u00e0-vis 379 FBCs per thousand square kilometres at the national level.

    "output": "To ensure quality and consistency in delivery of financial services at the last mile, a fair remuneration structure of BC agents relating to banking products and services may be worked out under the aegis of Indian Banks Association (IBA). To augment the scope of services offered by Fixed-Point BCs and to improve their sustenance in terms of earning potential, financial services providers should consider offering additional/value-added services through well-functioning BCs, based on an objective and transparent performance criterion, while meeting regulatory norms. The network of well-functioning FBCs may be leveraged for offering additional basic financial services, namely, basic mutual fund, pension and insurance products and related services, subject to meeting requisite criteria and regulatory norms. The existing BC registry portal being maintained by IBA provides a dynamic and comprehensive dataset to monitor the operations of BCs with a view to ensuring quality and last mile reach, and IBA should further strengthen and develop additional capabilities in the registry portal to improve periodic updation of the data, location mapping, de-duplication, certification status, etc. In order to expand digital financial services, the goal of reaching one billion users in digital payments ecosystem by December 2029 may guide further efforts in expanding the reach of such payment modes, since UPI recorded nearly 16.7 billion transactions during the month of December 2024, and there were 424 million unique UPI users in June 2024."

(c) Programmable CBDC to Facilitate Targeted Credit Flow and Expand Access: Programmability feature in Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) could help in tying up the end use, for example, agriculture credit by banks using CBDC can be programmed to ensure its use only at input store outlets. Similarly, for MSMEs etc., programmability may take care of the issue of diversion of funds and ensure optimum utilisation. Programmable CBDC may be leveraged to facilitate credit flow to underserved segments like tenant farmers, micro enterprises, etc., by conducting pilots of programmable CBDC across various borrower segments. Offline functionality in use cases may also be explored to make CBDC accessible to individuals in areas with limited or no connectivity. (d) Unified Lending Interface (ULI): Unified Lending Interface (ULI), as a DPI, has been conceptualised to enable delivery of frictionless credit by facilitating seamless flow of required digital information to lenders through conduct of pilots on various loan journeys, while onboarding of more and more lenders and data service providers.

SLBCs/UTLBCs should put in place a voluntary action plan adopted by member banks to deploy women as business correspondents in a phased manner to achieve the milestone by December 2028. With a view to providing suitable and timely financial services to the underserved and vulnerable segments, there is a need to develop suitable markers/matrix to be followed by financial services providers in dealing with such customers. Accordingly, financial sector regulators may develop an identification matrix both based on a combination of categorical and circumstantial factors. Going beyond the approach of offering low -cost universal financial products and services to promote financial inclusion, there is a need to focus on product suitability and personal suitability, especially for underserved and vulnerable segments. Accordingly, financial services providers should develop suitable basket of products (such as, basic MF products, calamity insurance, etc.) to meet the requirements of such segments. Financial sector regulators may appropriately mandate the development of such products. To strengthen financial security and financial resilience of people, suitable bundled products may be developed in the investment, pension, and insurance domains (e.g., a single insurance product offering life, health, accident, and property cover). To strengthen financial resilience of people, suitable and fair credit products with easier documentation process and quick disbursals should be launched especially for small ticket loans to prevent people from having to access informal sources of finance/ unauthorized digital lenders, etc. for small and urgent credit requirements."

CREs refer to locally rooted community organizations, such as cooperatives, trusts/societies, and NGOs, that would provide social intermediation within skilling for livelihood ecosystem.\nThe purpose of CREs is to create synergy in the financial inclusion ecosystem by offering community-oriented intermediation and localized support for facilitating access to skilling/livelihood, market linkages, and bank credit. It would create a trusted-assisted middle layer in form of a social infrastructure to undertake the following functions:\na. Assessment of training gap - CREs will collect data of unemployed, underemployed, school dropouts and other in need for skill training via survey or through participatory identification process.\nb.

    "output": "To improve financial inclusion assessment, several key recommendations are made. First, data collection efforts should cover all formal financial institutions in the financial inclusion ecosystem. Second, data should be captured at the district level, disaggregated by gender and age, to facilitate assessment of geographical, gender, and age-related dimensions in access and usage of financial products and services and gain cross-sectional insights. Customer data captured by financial services providers should include broad categories such as income level, education, occupation, and purpose to enable analysis and better positioning of policy measures. Widely acceptable and harmonized data definitions should be developed for select terminologies, such as Vulnerable Consumers and Migrants, for use across the financial sector for suitable interventions. Additionally, there is a need for developing a disaggregated FI Index, preferably at the State/UT level, to assess the extent of financial inclusion at the regional level.\nIn conjunction with supply-side data collection, demand-side measurement is necessary to gather details about the barriers to access and usage of financial services, and quality of inclusion, especially at the last mile. This can be done through demand-side surveys/focus group studies, which can reveal the drivers of financial inclusion and help identify socio-economic factors, suitability of products and services, debt vulnerabilities at the household level, level of financial literacy and capability, and the state of grievance redress. Focusing on the end user\u2019s perspective, the demand-side measurement has the potential to throw light on aspects such as alignment of need and demand, bottlenecks in the delivery of financial services at the last mile, regional inadequacies, and evolving preferences."

Also, leveraging Geo-Spatial Information Technology, a robust monitoring framework can be developed for monitoring progress under financial inclusion, with special emphasis on Aspirational Districts, North Eastern Region, and Left-Wing Extremist affected Districts, with a monitoring framework and a GIS dashboard to be developed by March 2022.\n\nAchievements include SLBC/UTLBCs, in co-ordination with RBI ROs, monitoring and reviewing progress made under access to livelihood and skill development and social security schemes (PMJJBY, PMSBY, APY). The Government of India has launched a Geographic Information System (GIS) based app, namely Jan-Dhan Darshak (JDD) App, developed by the National Informatics Centre (NIC). The App displays the availability of banking outlets within 5 km of all inhabited villages. Coverage of unbanked villages is regularly monitored based on the information updated by banks on the JDD App, with SLBCs playing a constructive role in identifying unbanked locations and ensuring banking presence in all such locations. Furthermore, regarding monitoring the progress under financial inclusion, RBI has constructed a composite Financial Inclusion (FI) Index, which holistically measures the extent of financial inclusion in the country. The FI Index is a comprehensive index having sub-indices for the three dimensions of financial inclusion (access, usage, and quality), comprising parameters from all the financial domain viz. banking, insurance, pension, investment as well postal. The FI-Index has been published every year since 2021, offering insights into the progress made and helping to identify gaps in the FI space, to be addressed by the concerned stakeholder. Review of progress made under the FI-Index is also a regular agenda item in the meetings of the Technical Group of Financial Inclusion and Financial Literacy (TGFIFL) under the Financial Stability and Development Council \u2013 Sub Committee (FSDC-SC)."

    "input": "Question: What role do Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) play in India, and what challenges do they face?",
    "output": "The Primary (Urban) Cooperative Banks (UCBs) play an important role in furthering financial inclusion by generally providing traditional, if not the more modern, banking services to persons in the less included segments of the economic strata. World over, financial cooperatives in different forms, as banks and closed loop societies with access to the payment system, have varying market presence. In India, only the financial cooperatives which are licensed to undertake banking business are regulated and supervised by the financial sector regulator, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). The banks in the rural cooperative sector are supervised by NABARD, although regulated by the RBI.\nUCBs have the potential to be the harbinger of economic empowerment of the large number of financially excluded persons in the country. As per information provided to the Committee, the number of borrowers of UCBs is 67 lakh. This is not a small number by itself and there are many cases of transformational changes that UCBs have brought to its customers. However, seen in the context of a very large number of persons yet to have access to formal credit, what has been achieved is not enough either from the standpoint of potential or need. The factors that have resulted in sub-potential performance of the UCB sector are multifarious, some endogenous to the sector and others external.\nThere were two broad sources of constraints because of which the sector has underperformed. The first set of factors are internal to the sector. Many UCBs are small and do not have either the capability - financial or human resources \u2013 and/or possibly inclination to provide technology-enabled financial services. These banks continue to leverage on member loyalty to remain in business. This can wane with time, generational changes and, of course, competition. Secondly, because of their small size, a large number of these banks have not had the benefit of professional management and committed governance by people who understand not only the spirit of co-operation but also principles of banking to take a bank to the next level. While one of the arguments for the existence of smaller cooperatives is that they actually reduce intermediation costs, the empirical evidence of the relatively higher Net Interest Margins ( NIMs) of the smaller cooperative banks may be pointing to the contrary. These are not translating into sustainable return on assets either. While high cost to income ratio coupled with high NPAs are among the reasons, the unsustainability of the low scale of operations is at the core of the problem.\nThe second set of constraints are external to the banks. These emanate from the rather restrictive regulatory environment under which they have had to operate. This regulatory approach has been driven by several factors. The dual control regime that characterised the regulatory legislation for UCBs meant that many aspects of a bank\u2019s functioning, which impinged"

    "output": "The second set of constraints are external to the banks. These emanate from the rather restrictive regulatory environment under which they have had to operate. This regulatory approach has been driven by several factors. The dual control regime that characterised the regulatory legislation for UCBs meant that many aspects of a bank\u2019s functioning, which impinged on the sustainable operations of the bank, were outside the purview of the RBI. Similarly, the UCBs did not have many avenues to raise capital and the cooperative principle of \u201cone member \u2013 one vote\u201d led to the investment horizon of a shareholder being largely borrowing centric, making it even more difficult to raise capital when a bank is unable to lend."

    "input": "Question: What role should the Umbrella Organisation (UO) play in the Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) sector, and how should it be empowered?",
    "output": "The Umbrella Organisation (UO) should be expedited and empowered to be a game changer for the UCB sector. NAFCUB should expedite the process of setting it up, ensuring it is financially strong and well-governed by a professional board and senior management. The UO should provide cross liquidity and capital support to UCBs, as well as cloud services for IT-enabled operations. It should standardize the IT platform across member UCBs, provide ongoing innovation at lower costs, and act as a branding partner. The UO's eligibility for a Certificate of Registration should assess its control function capabilities, and it should be closely regulated and supervised. Differentiated regulation should incentivize smaller UCBs to join, recognizing the UO's role in providing operational and financial strength. The UO can also identify training needs for staff and directors of member banks. While primarily intended for smaller entities to acquire scale through networking, larger UCBs should be encouraged to embrace the UO as well. The UO\u2019s capital required to get a Certificate of Registration (COR) should be raised by its promoters and others who would support the establishment of the UO. An important recent step has been taken to grant in -principle for the setting up of an Umbrella Organisation. (UO). The thought process on the UO has evolved over a long period of time since it was first mooted in 2006. As an alt ernative to mandatory consolidation, the Committee prefers smaller banks acquiring scale through the network of the UO, which is one of the successful models of a strong financial cooperative system globally. Further, due to the aggregation being done by the UO, it will provide to all member banks the benefit of innovation on an ongoing basis, including the advantages from emerging advancements on the IT front at lower cost.\nSince the basic functionalities of the UO have already crystallised, the UO should be adequately empowered to be able to discharge its role as the apex entity of the federating UCBs. It should therefore be regulated and supervised closely. Recognising the important role of the UO in providing operational and financial strength to the smaller UCBs, the differentiated regulation should have a built-in incentive for the smaller UCBs to join in.  The UO can emerge as the focal point for identifying training needs of the staff and directors of its member banks. It will need to train the persons working at the front end of the member banks and also on other aspects of their banking business. The UO is envisaged as the arrangement for the smaller entities to acquire scale through network. However, it can also emerge as the brand builder for the cooperative banking sector in its entirety. While there may not be a regulatory imperative for the larger banks to federate with the UO, steps should be taken by the system to encourage the larger UCBs to embrace the UO."

    "output": "Once the required capital has been raised, the Certificate of Registration (COR) is issued, and permission to commence business has been granted, the RBI could consider providing a one-time grant to the UO for a specific objective tied to the IT support the UO intends to provide to its member banks. This grant will not be part of the equity capital, which obviates the typical conflict of interest arising from the regulator being a shareholder in the regulated entity. Since aggregation of IT services will be a financial inclusion enabler and can also contribute to system-stability through standardization of the IT interface, there is justification for RBI\u2019s financial support to the UO. The UO should provide cross liquidity and capital support to the UCBs when needed, as also the cloud services for facilitating IT-enabled operations by the member banks."

The Committee believes that while regulatory neutrality towards voluntary mergers should be the default approach, the powers to order compulsory amalgamation should be used as the backstop to encourage voluntary mergers of banks that are not complying with the regulatory capital requirements but are still solvent. This will also require that supervisory interventions are more timely and decisive. The RBI should develop a playbook of alternative options linked to size and complexity of a weak bank to enable the choice of a particular resolution tool. Also, a minimum net worth of \u20b92 crore for unit banks and \u20b95 crore for single district banks on top of the prescribed CRAR was agreed upon."

They believed that pursuing a specific market share or growth rate could lead to a rush for balance sheet growth, increasing the risk of adverse selection and systemic or idiosyncratic instability, which would be detrimental to the sector's overall interests.

    "output": "Co-operatives are people-centred enterprises owned, controlled, and run by and for their members to realise their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations. Historically, co-operatives emerged by challenging the primacy of capital. While all the services rendered by a firm were pre-negotiated, capital was compensated with the residuals. The objective of a capital-centric corporation was completely predicated on maximizing these residuals. The other systems that evolved around this objective were also oriented towards the primacy of and reward for capital. Whether it pertained to control, rewards or performance evaluation, they were broadly focussed on how a firm was delivering returns to the investors of risk capital. In this sense, the co-operatives were a different form of organisation."

    "output": "The members of financial co-operatives are not uniquely net borrowers or net savers, and their role could change from time to time. In the case of financial co-operatives, the unique features of a co-operative entity, viz. being member-owned, member-driven, and member-controlled businesses, would translate to increasing the return on savings and reducing the interest on loans to members while ensuring adequate margins and surpluses for ploughing back for sustainability and growth. Ideally, a co-operative should do its core business only with its members and not with the public at large. On the other hand, a bank, by definition, is expected to deal with the public at large. By virtue of being a bank, there is a heightened sense of safety because banking institutions are not only licensed after due diligence but are also highly regulated compared to other entities in the financial sector. A financial co-operative becomes a bank when it is licensed to receive deposits, which are withdrawable on demand, from non-members as well. It also becomes eligible to be a part of the payment system. Once an institution is a bank, it can also offer complex products beyond plain vanilla savings and credit facilities. Some of these products could be provided only if the institution is large and a part of the interconnected world \u2013 whether it is for remittances through the payment system or offering a credit card facility or facilitating transactions on other instruments such as mutual funds, derivatives, and the like. Since banks are in the business of leverage, the question of capital becomes very important for the stability of the organization. Herein lies the paradox: an organization designed to meet the requirements of its members on the principle of mutuality, by becoming a bank, morphs into an organization where capital is central to its operations."

    "input": "Question: How do co-operative banks operate in terms of resources and leverage, and what is their legal status compared to banking companies?",
    "output": "Co-operative banks are able to work with a high leverage due to the normal regulatory capital requirements applied to them. As such, co-operative banks are exceptions in the co-operative sector, wherein the resources used for lending and investment come from the public rather than just their members.\n\nThe legal status of co-operative banks is akin to banking companies in many ways. Both are body corporates by the name in which they are registered, with limited liabilities, which can sue and be sued in their own name, with independent legal personalities distinct from their shareholders/members, with power to acquire, hold and dispose of property and enter into contract. However, there are certain vital distinctions between the two types of banks, primarily arising out of their structure, which need to be considered while formulating a regulatory regime for UCBs. The most fundamental difference between the banking companies and co-operative banks is in the rights of the shareholders to vote in resolutions. While in the case of a banking company, each share has a vote (subject to the limitations imposed by Section 12 of the BR Act), in the case of a co-operative bank, each shareholder has only one vote irrespective of the number of shares held."

    "input": "Question: What are some key points regarding the regulation, structural issues, and regulatory policies affecting co-operative banks, as discussed in the executive summary?",
    "output": "The regulation of co-operative banks by the RBI has largely been restricted to their \u2018banking\u2019 business, with governance, audit, reconstruction/amalgamation and winding-up related functions being in the domain of the state governments (in case of single-state banks, i.e., banks whose area of operation is confined to a single state) and the Central Government (in case of multi-state banks, i.e., banks whose area of operation extends to more than one state). Governance functions have rather been loosely regulated even by the Governments because of the perception of the UCBs being democratic institutions. Owing to lack of the desired level of regulatory comfort on account of the structural issues including \u2018capital\u2019 and the gaps in the statutory framework, the regulatory policies for co-operative banks have been restrictive with regard to their business operations, which, to some extent, has been one of the reasons affecting their growth. With the enactment of the Banking Regulation (Amendment) Act, 2020, the statutory gaps have been addressed to a very large extent. The Committee considered it appropriate to articulate the guiding principles which would inform its approach to the issues covered by the Terms of Reference, in assimilating the feedback received during stakeholder consultations, directing the deliberations within the Committee, and for identifying most of the recommenda tions. The Committee notes that having regard to the heterogeneity of the sector, the smaller banks, which are more rooted in co -operative principles, should be allowed to acquire scale through the network of the Umbrella Organisation, while the larger ones should have scale on a stand-alone basis. The Committee observed that focus of the regulatory policies during the last five years has been to mitigate the risks in the banking business of UCBs, keeping in view the various constraints such as heterogeneity of the sector, limitations in the form of constraints in raising capital and non-availability of resolution tools under the provisions of the BR Act and, in general, lack of adequate regulatory control of the RBI. The Committee, h owever, did not find any regulatory changes brought about in the last five years to be largely limiting the growth of the UCBs. Nevertheless, it noted that the restrictive approach of the earlier years towards branch expansion, scheduling, which continued to be pursued on top of a more enabling regulatory approach towards business operations of the other banking and non-banking entities did hamstring the ability of the UCBs to grow. The Committee also noted that this approach was rooted in the inadequacy of regulatory powers with the RBI under the then existing legislative framework."

    "input": "Question: What were the key observations and recommendations of the Committee regarding the UCB sector?",
    "output": "The Committee noted that the UCB sector has been under stress for quite some time. It felt that given the importance of the sector in furthering financial inclusion and considering the large number of its customer base, it is imperative that the strategies adopted for the regulation of the sector are comprehensively reviewed so as to enhance its resilience and provide an enabling environment for its sustainable and stable growth in the medium term. The Committee carried out a SWOT analysis of the UCB sector and identified factors contributing to their strength and weakness as also the opportunities and threats they are likely to encounter. In the Committee\u2019s view, while it was possible that the structural factors arising from the co-operative character underlying the UCBs could still pose some challenges, the amendments to the BR Act address to a large extent the gaps in the legislative framework, which informed the extant approach of the RBI towards regulation and supervision of UCBs. Consequently, since the UCBs have the potential of driving financial inclusion and credit delivery to those with limited means, the regulatory policies can now be more enabling. The Committee also discussed the issue of parallel statutory provisions in the BR Act and the co-operative societies\u2019 laws, which was raised by UCBs and their federations during their interaction with the Committee. These are considered more to be administrative challenges rather than legislative conflicts. The Committee observed that given the heterogeneity in the sector, a tiered regulatory framework with more than two tiers is required to balance the spirit of mutuality and co-operation more prevalent in banks of smaller sizes and those with limited area of operation vis-\u00e0-vis the growth ambitions of the large-sized UCBs to spread their area of operation and undertake more complex business activities on par with commercial banks. The Committee agreed that the deposit size can continue to be the basis for categorising banks into regulatory tiers, as for a normally functioning bank, deposit size can broadly serve as proxy for capital size and net worth. Further, additional tiers could be created to cater to the aspirations of the larger UCBs to undertake business akin to that of SFBs and UNBs. With regard to the minimum capital and reserve (net worth) requirement for UCBs, irrespective of CRAR, one view favoured the status quo, arguing that the smaller UCBs have a long history of surviving and serving their customers, despite their small size. The Committee felt that a liberal regulatory approach may be adopted for UCBs that meet a certain minimum level of capital and reserves (net worth) and CRAR requirements. Further, membership of the UO might also provide an extra comfort to the regulator as the smaller UCBs would benefit from the products and services provided by the UO."

TAFCUB intervention may also be envisaged if the divergence is large, leading to a significant increase in NNPA and a reduction in CRAR. Such banks may be flagged for discussions in TAFCUB and early intervention. During the process of stakeholder consultation, some UCBs suggested that TAFCUB should have a forum to study early warning signals of UCBs heading towards imposition of SAF. Concerns were expressed over the limited role of TAFCUB after introduction of SAF by the RBI, while some banks also mentioned that the regulatory action taken by the RBI should be in consonance with the decision of the TAFCUB."

    "output": "The UO is expected to play a crucial role in strengthening the NBFC sector, particularly for the largest segment, by evaluating the quality of internal controls as it also takes on the role of a Self-Regulatory Organization (SRO). In the long run, the UO may become an SRO for smaller UCBs, running an independent audit/inspection and supervisory division for both offsite and onsite supervision, open to all types of cooperatives. The members' contributions to the UO may be in the nature of share capital, with incremental membership potentially involving premiums. Once the UO stabilizes, it may explore converting into a universal bank and offering value-added services for member banks, which may encourage smaller UCBs to become an extended arm of such a bank. The RBI could also consider providing a one-time grant to the UO for a specific objective tied to providing IT support to its member banks and can also contribute to system stability through standardisation of the IT interface.

    "input": "Question: What are the recommendations on Supervisory Action Framework (SAF) and Consolidation?",
    "output": "The recommendations on Supervisory Action Framework (SAF) and Consolidation are as follows:\n\ni) SAF should follow a twin -indicator approach, i.e., it should consider only asset quality and capital measured through NNPA and CRAR instead of triple indicators at present. Additional provisioning suggested by the Inspecting Officers (IOs) should be adjusted from GNPA to arrive at assessed NNPA similar to the adjustments in Tier I capital done to arrive at assessed CRAR to determine whether SAF triggers are hit. The objective of the SAF should be to find a time-bound remedy to the financial stress of a bank. (Para 8.6.2 and 8.6.3.1).\n\nii) As hitherto, actions under the SAF may continue to be segregated into mandatory and discretionary. The action based on the suggested twin indicators may be taken by the RBI without reference to TAFCUB. However, there could be banks with other supervisory concerns like stress in profitability, governance-related concerns, etc., all of which call for further corrective action on the part of the banks. These may be considered for discretionary action in consultation with TAFCUB for banks in Tiers 1 and 2. (Para 8.6.3.2)\n\niii) All-inclusive directions should be treated on par with moratorium under Section 45 of BR Act and, if imposed, a bank should not continue thereunder beyond the time permitted to keep a bank under moratorium viz., three months extendable by a maximum of another three months. It is recommended that at some stage, the weak banks should be visited with a regulatory nudge to explore the possibility of voluntary merger or conversion into a non -banking society at an early stage with the clear understanding that in the absence thereof, the powers for mandatory resolution would be employed. (Para 8.6.3.3)\n\niv) In view of the powers derived from the recent amendment, the RBI may strive to begin the mandatory resolution process including reconstruction or compulsory merger as soon as a UCB reaches Stage III under the SAF. The RBI may also consider superseding the Board if the bank fails to submit voluntary merger / conversion proposal within the prescribed timeframe and take necessary steps to avoid undue flight of deposits once the news becomes public. (Para 8.6.3.4)\n\nv) A broad structure for SAF as recommended by the Committee is contained at Para 8.6.3.5."

    "output": "The Committee considered it appropriate to deliberate on and articulate the guiding principles which informed its approach to the issues covered by the terms of reference in assimilating the feedback received during stakeholder consultations, directing the deliberations within the Committee, and finally for identifying most of the recommendations. These guiding principles are delineated below:\n\nMutuality and Scale:\nThe Committee considered the spirit of mutuality and co-operation at the member level and the principles of banking at the system and regulation level as one of the guiding principles. Traditionally, financial co-operatives have been community-based organisations \u2013 whether they are co-operative societies or credit unions \u2013 established on the principle of mutuality. Very much like the current day self-help groups, the principle of mutuality addressed the issue of lack of information (credit history or transaction trail) which is used in assessment of loans and leveraged on the knowledge of the community to assess risk. Since these institutions were envisaged as closed-loop institutions, their handshake with the external world was minimal. With the advent of technology and credit scoring systems, this needs to be redefined. Furthermore, a co-operative society leverages on co-operation whereas a bank leverages on capital. This friction is at the core of finding an optimal balance in adoption of the right approach to regulation and supervision of UCBs. The Committee feels that the regulatory framework needs to leverage the advantages that go with the co-operativeness of smaller UCBs in the form of proximity of the bank\u2019s business operations to the customers, mutual trust, commonness of objectives leading to greater loyalty, benefit of informal channels of information, etc.\n\nApproach regarding Statutory Provisions:\nThe legislative changes are taken as given and the Committee did not examine the feasibility or maintainability of the statutory provisions in the wake of the recent amendments to the BR Act and noted that by the construct of the legislation, the provisions of the BR Act would prevail, if they are in contradiction to the provisions of the Co-operative Societies\u2019 Act under which a UCB is registered. The Committee took the view that it should instead work broadly based on the design principles that were necessary. The Committee, however, took note of some stakeholders\u2019 viewpoint that the functionaries vested with the responsibility of the implementation of the Co-operative Societies laws may be prone to acting in a manner similar to the pre-amendment times. This could be a source for friction and cause complications in the smooth conduct of the UCBs\u2019"

    "input": "Question: What are the implications of the legislative amendments and the shift in the legislative approach to co-operative bank regulation, including the conflict between the provisions of the BR Act and the Co-operative Laws?",
    "output": "As a result of the recent amendments to the BR Act, certain conflicts had arisen between the provisions of the amended BR Act and that of the various co-operative laws, especially when it comes to sources of raising capital. The BR Act explicitly allows co-operative banks to issue shares at a premium, but it is silent on their redemption. If any co-operative societies\u2019 legislation provides for redemption of shares only at par, then while a co-operative bank incorporated under that legislation can issue shares at a premium, it can redeem them only at par. Co-operative societies carrying on banking business were brought under the purview of the BR Act in the year 1966 by inserting a new Section 56 to the Act. Given the construct of section 56 of the Act prior to the recent amendments, the approach of the legislation was that even if a co-operative society was licensed as a bank, the underlying society had to be more governed by the Act under which it was set up rather than the Act under which it was licensed as a bank. The BR Act, post the recent amendments, reverses this philosophy to quite an extent and underscores the importance of regulating such entities as banks rather than as co-operative societies in the interest of depositors and in public interest. One of the major concerns with regard to regulation of UCBs has been the absence of regulatory powers for RBI over their management, which made regulation of their banking business difficult insofar as RBI could hardly take any significant steps to bring about improvement in the quality of their management and governance."

    "output": "With a shift in the legislative framework consequent upon the recent amendments to the BR Act, it could be argued that the RBI now stands more empowered to regulate UCBs. Even as it recognized the need for and possibility of revisiting the current regulatory and supervisory template in the wake of the legislative changes, the Committee noted that any revised architecture will have to factor the extreme heterogeneity which the entities in the UCB sector display. The entities in the sector are quite heterogeneous in terms of size, geographical spread, business models, skill levels, technology adoption, clientele, etc. Even the laws bringing the underlying co-operative society into being and governing them are different as every state has its own Co-operative Societies\u2019 Act with some such as Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, etc. having more than one, and there is a multi-state co-operative law as well. Given the heterogeneity, a \u2018one size fits al\u2019\u201d regulatory approach creates constraints on resilience as well as growth of the banks. The framework should therefore strike an appropriate balance between putting in place tailor -made regulations that adequately recognize heterogeneity on the one hand, and avoiding multiple tiers of regulation to reduce complexity, on the other. In designing the approach, the Committee thought it fit to create, to the extent possible, the divide based on how closer or farther a bank\u2019s functioning to co-operative principles is likely to be."

    "output": "Maintaining a connection with the complex financial world is important even for the smallest person as it opens up opportunities to access a diverse range of financial products. In order to achieve this, the Committee kept the concept of an Umbrella Organisation (UO) as a pivotal point that would provide backstop arrangements for entities that continued to be small. The UO, when fully evolved, would provide the following backstop arrangements:\n\uf0b7 Access to cloud-based technology, which could be used on a shared basis\n\uf0b7 Access to payment systems, interchange, and common branding for offering products based on technology (payments interface, cards)\n\uf0b7 Access to other financial products that could be cross-sold \u2013 insurance, mutual funds, pensions, and other financial products\n\uf0b7 Access to capital and liquidity support in case of stress to a particular member co-operative\n\uf0b7 Access to branding\nThe Committee recognized that the changes to the legislative framework have made the RBI a more empowered regulator and supervisor on the one hand and provided additional tools for UCBs for raising capital on the other hand. The Committee was, therefore, of the view that such of the co-operative banks which are large should be treated on par with any other commercial bank for the supervisory and regulatory purposes. They should be required to raise capital as per the prevailing norms and would be provided autonomy to offer services and grow, on par with any other bank offering a similar range of services, and there would be no discrimination because of the form of incorporation being that of a co-operative. While there would be some guiding principles on how such organizations could meet the stringent capital requirements, the details could be left to the organizations on how they would adequately capitalize themselves in order to meet the requirements. The role of the regulator would be in applying (a) the test of permanency of capital and (b) fit-and-proper norms for governance and management."

    "input": "Question: What role have Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) played in the Indian banking system, and what are their key characteristics and historical context?",
    "output": "The UCBs have played a significant role in furthering financial inclusion since the time when they had not yet become a significant aspect of public policy in general, and banking policy in particular. The co-operative movement began as an alternative to mainstream business models which were seen to be more exploitative and less inclusive of people in the lower economic strata. Prior to the amendments brought to the BR Act in 1966 whereby certain provisions of that Act were extended to co-operative societies, they were already undertaking banking business, implying that they were accepting public deposits for making loans and investments. The UCBs are primary co-operatives which, by law, are barred from enrolling another co-operative society as a member.\nUCBs have been traditionally centred around communities, localities, work -place groups, etc. and organised on the principles of mutual aid, practice of thrift, and self-help. They play a role in last-mile credit delivery, more importantly, to the segments of the population less welcome by the mainstream banking segment. While a large section of the financially excluded population inhabits rural areas, financial exclusion is widespread in urban and semi -urban areas as well which has been the focus area of the UCBs as they primarily lend to wage earners, small entrepreneurs and businesses residing/operating in urban and semi -urban areas. Furthermore, being rooted in local communities, UCBs can be more responsive to the needs of the local people.\nKeeping in view the substantial increase in operations of co -operative banks, it was considered necessary to bring their banking business under the regulatory powers of RBI for protecting the interests of the depositors as also to extend deposit insurance to their depositors. Accordingly, UCBs were brought under the regulatory purview of RBI with effect from March 1, 1966. It can be observed that in 1967, there were about 1106 UCBs with deposits and advances of \u20b9153 crore and \u20b9167 crore, which increased to 1390 UCBs with deposits and advances of \u20b98660 crore and \u20b96800 crore, respectively in 1990. The UCBs witnessed considerable growth in the 1990s on the back of a supportive licensing environment. The UCBs witnessed a growth in market share in the banking business in the country during this period because of their less formal approach to banking, decisions being based more on personal knowledge of the borrower."

It may also be noted that UCBs cater to the financial needs of about 8.52 crore depositors and 67 lakh borrowers, who are mainly from low-income segments of the population.

    "output": "The sector\u2019s interest income to total income ratio is generally comparable with other players. However, their non-interest income is on the lower side, which is understandable given their limited avenues for generating fee-based income.\n\nThe Committee noted and discussed certain important regulatory measures taken by RBI in the last five years. These measures can broadly be categorized under Prudential, Business Conduct and Governance related measures. The Prudential Measures can further be divided into General Measures and Risk Mitigation Measures. These measures are:\n\nRisk Mitigation Measures:\n\ni) Placement of Deposits with Other Banks by Primary (Urban) Co-operative Banks (UCBs) \u2013 With a view to reducing the concentration risk in respect of placement of deposits with other UCBs, prudential gross interbank exposure limit and prudential counter party limits were set at 20 per cent and 5 per cent of the deposit liabilities, respectively, vide circular dated November 19, 2015. The circular also stipulated the criteria subject to which Scheduled UCBs would be able to accept deposits from other UCBs.\n\nii) Unsecured Exposure Norms for UCBs \u2013 Relaxation \u2013 Circular dated April 21, 2016 was issued to give impetus to financial inclusion by UCBs with a large priority sector loan portfolio by permitting them to have larger unsecured loan portfolio, subject to fulfilment of certain conditions.\n\niii) Reporting of Large exposures to CRILC - Circular dated December 27, 2019 provided instructions on reporting of large exposures of UCBs, i.e., loans of more than \u20b95 crores to CRILC for timely identification of stress, and categorisation of accounts based on incipient stress.\n\niv) Comprehensive Cyber Security framework \u2013 Circular dated December 31, 2019 prescribed a graded approach for cyber security by categorizing UCBs into four levels based on their digital depth and interconnectedness to the payment systems landscape.\n\nv) Revised Exposure Limits and target for Priority Sector Lending \u2013 With a view to mitigating concentration risk by increasing granularity in the loan portfolio, single borrower and group borrower exposure limits for UCBs were reduced, vide circular dated March 13, 2020. UCBs were also mandated to have at least 50 per cent of their aggregate loans and advances comprising loans of not more than \u20b925 lakh or 0.2 per cent of their Tier I capital, whichever is higher, subject to a maximum of \u20b91 crore, per borrower/party. Priority Sector Lending target for UCBs was increased from 40 per cent to 75 per cent of ANBC/CEOBSE. An appropriate glide path was provided to UCBs to achieve the above targets by March 31, 2024."

It may be mentioned that access to LAF was already provided to them in 2014. (ii) Review of Supervisory Action Framework - Circular dated January 06, 2020 further rationalized the SAF to make it more effective in bringing about the desired improvement in the UCBs as also expeditious resolution of UCBs experiencing financial stress. (iii) Risk-Based Internal Audit (RBIA) \u2013 Circular dated February 03, 2021 was issued to UCBs with asset size of \u20b9500 crores and above, with a stipulation of implementing Risk Based Internal Audit (RBIA) framework by March 31, 2022 in accordance with the Guidelines provided in the circular. The Guidelines are intended to enhance the efficacy of internal audit systems and processes followed by the UCBs.\nRegarding business conduct measures: (i) Customer Protection - Limiting Liability of Customers of Co-operative Banks in Unauthorised Electronic Banking Transactions - Circular dated December 14, 2017 was issued in the wake of increased thrust on IT enabled financial inclusion and related customer protection issues, surge in customer grievances relating to unauthorised transactions resulting in debits to their accounts/cards.

    "output": "The Committee observed that the focus of the regulatory policies during the last five years has been to mitigate the risks in the banking business, keeping in view the various constraints such as lack of adequate regulatory control in the absence of enabling statutory provisions, heterogeneity of the sector and the limitations in the form of constraints in raising capital and non-availability of resolution tools under the provisions of the BR Act. Further, there has been an attempt to leverage the benefits arising out of use of IT in banking and to prepare UCBs for the challenges arising out of it. The Committee, therefore, did not find any regulatory changes brought about in the last five years to be largely limiting the growth of the UCBs. In fact, some of the changes like extension of interest subvention scheme have been more enabling. Nevertheless, it noted that the restrictive approach of the earlier years towards branch expansion, scheduling, which continued to be pursued on top of a more enabling regulatory approach towards business operations of the other banking and non-banking entities did hamstring the ability of the UCBs to grow. The Committee also noted that this approach was rooted in the inadequacy of regulatory powers with the RBI under the then existing legislative framework."

After each supervisory assessment, RBI assigns a composite supervisory rating to UCBs based on Capital Adequacy, Asset Quality, Management, Earning, Liquidity and System and Controls (CAMELS). The rating reflects the financial health and the quality of the internal systems of a bank at a given point in time. The ratings were being assigned until March 31, 2019, on a four-point scale ranging from A to D in decreasing order of financial strength and quality of the management. The rating model has been reviewed with effect from March 31, 2020, to a five-point scale inserting a new rating point of B+. The number of UCBs which have been rated C or D has increased from 21.86 per cent to 25.53 per cent of the total UCBs over the last five years."

    "output": "The Committee deliberated on the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats for the UCB sector, keeping in view the objective to enhance its resilience and provide an enabling environment for its sustainable and stable growth in the medium term. For this purpose, the Committee also considered the inputs received from the stakeholders with whom it had interacted and from the questionnaire-based survey.\n\nStrengths of UCBs mainly derive from their co-operative character. The principle of democratic member control gives a sense of ownership to members and ensures high customer loyalty. Further, their closeness to the grassroots and consequent understanding of the local environment makes them well placed to further financial inclusion and facilitating last mile delivery of financial services. The UCBs have been observed to be taking quick decisions, primarily because of less bureaucratic systems in their organizations. Interestingly, as a UCB grows, it tends to move away from the co-operative character and, thus, the strengths arising out of the same keep on diminishing. The above-mentioned strengths are more relevant to smaller UCBs in the sector.\n\nThe major weaknesses of the sector also stem from its co-operative character. The three major weaknesses are constraints in raising capital, lack of professional management often leading to weak internal control systems and inadequate IT capabilities coupled with lack of skilled personnel. The problem other than that of raising capital is more prevalent in the smaller banks and have a bearing on their ability to remain relevant in the changing landscape of banking.\n\nThe sector is poised with a \u2018still to be explored\u2019 and untapped market, particularly for smaller ticket loan segment of low-income groups. The growing opportunities come from the agenda of financial inclusion and from the sector\u2019s ability to tailor products and offer fee-based income products. This will of course require the smaller UCBs in particular to keep their local feel while finding solutions to the problems associated with their smaller size, which the proposed UO could cater to.\n\nThe biggest threat to the sector is acute market competition emanating from multiple existing players and new entrants like payment banks, SFBs, FinTechs, etc. which are equipped with state-of-the-art technology coupled with deep pockets. These have the potential to disrupt UCBs\u2019 traditionally natural market segments both due to regulatory."

Further, instances of failure of some larger UCBs in recent years have adversely affected the sector\u2019s image and has led to loss of public trust.

The co-operative societies are guided by certain core principles like voluntary and open membership, democratic control by members through the concept of, one-person-one-vote, etc. In a financial co-operative doing the business of banking and, therefore, requiring higher capital as well as professional management, these become constraining factors. One of the factors contributing to the \u2018less than satisfactory growth\u2019 of UCBs is their limited ability to raise capital and, thus, restricting the capacity to reinforce resilience and expand business. As per the co-operative principles and laws, the share/equity capital must be issued and is refundable, and both at face value only. The absence of any accretion to the value of investment by way of premium and the lack of a formal mode of realising premium even if the book value of the shares has gone up, makes buying shares of a co-operative bank an unattractive investment proposition. Furthermore, they are not of interest to a potential investor seeking control as the \u2018one member one vote\u2019 principle does not render a UCB amenable to acquiring controlling interest. Yet another constraint is the non-permanence of capital because of \u2018voluntary and open membership\u2019 in the co-operative structure. Any person can become a member of co-operative society voluntarily by subscribing to a minimum number of equity shares subject to the admissibility. The members can leave the society at their will, subject to certain conditions, by withdrawing their share capital. Thus, the refundable or withdrawable nature of share/equity capital adversely affects the conservation of capital resulting in share capital of co-operative society lacking perpetuity."

    "output": "In a financial co-operative, the approach to capital becomes complicated due to the financial services involved. The first contradiction arises when the co-operative extends beyond a closed loop (lending limited to members' savings) and involves non-members without granting or obligating membership. This creates two categories of transactors: those inside the loop with say and vote, and those outside without. The second contradiction emerges from democratic control, where governance positions don't necessarily represent significant stake or patronage. Furthermore, while corporations use incentive-disincentive structures to mitigate mal-governance risks, co-operatives rely on goodwill due to the nature of undistributed profits and reserves being vested with the 'system' rather than individual members. Consequently, the regulatory focus on capital adequacy to protect depositors' interests becomes problematic as member share capital is withdrawable, return on capital is limited, and there's little incentive to retain capital if not used for borrowing, making co-operatives weakly capitalized by design."

    "output": "To address the contradictions within financial cooperatives, especially concerning the protection of public deposits and systemic importance, some possible ways include: 1. Converting a significant portion of profits into a member-identifiable and distributable/withdrawable pool, reducing resources in the no-person zone. 2. Ensuring these resources remain somewhat permanently, or at least a significant core remains stable. 3. Introducing an entry premium for new members by marking the entry to the book value of the shares, thereby getting new members to contribute not only to the equity but also through an entry premium in a member-identifiable non-withdrawable pool. 4. While honoring the principle of open membership, imposing some level of stickiness in the principle to recognize the business of banking and the need for stability. Member resources with reasonable restrictions on withdrawability could be treated as capital for prudential purposes of capital adequacy. This can be achieved by: 1. Allowing capital withdrawal only on cessation of membership, but after a certain minimum time period from investment (e.g., ten years). 2. Compulsorily transferring a significant part of current profits to member-identifiable reserves, with payouts at the time of cessation of membership subject to capital adequacy. 3. Requiring all new members to purchase shares at face value and contribute pro-rata to the per-share reserves accumulated by the cooperative, providing an entry premium."

    "output": "A member wanting to cease to be a member could also have the option of finding a new member to purchase the shares and transferring the elements of stickiness to the new member. The regulator should also be given overriding powers to prevent the co-operative from redeeming the capital if the regulator believes that the co-operative bank will not be adhering to the minimum capital norms as specified, if the retirement of capital is given effect to. UCBs are democratic organisations which are controlled by their members and managed through a representative body, the \u2018Board of Directors\u2019. In pursuance of the democratic principles, the members of the Board are necessarily elected from amongst the members of the bank. This often translates into insufficient skill sets, lack of required expertise and desired qualifications amongst the directors leading to lack of professional management of the UCBs. The UCBs are registered as co-operative societies under the Co-operative Societies laws of Centre or States. They are also regulated by RBI since 1966 when some of the provisions of the BR Act were extended to UCBs. Thereafter started the era of dual regulation, wherein the banking related functions of a UCB were regulated by RBI under the provisions of BR Act and powers with regard to incorporation, management, audit and winding up continued to be governed by the co-operative societies acts concerned. This system of dual regulation is often claimed to have been one of the important factors responsible for the less than satisfactory performance of the UCB sector. Over the years RBI had taken non -legislative measures to mitigate some of the conflicts created by this system of duality of regulation, by entering into Memorand a of Understanding (MoU) with all the state governments and the Central Government creating a working arrangement between RBI and the governments. As a part of the MoUs, a forum of Task Force for Urban Co-operative Banks (TAFCUB) was set up for each state (and one for the Centre) with representations from RBI, the concerned government and the UCB sector representatives. While the TAFCUB mechanism resolved the problems of duality of regulation to some extent, the core problems continue to persist. Therefore, the Committee was of the view that legislative steps undertaken through the Banking Regulation (Amendment) Act, 2020, which brought management / governance, audit, reconstructions / amalgamation, winding up, etc. of co-operative banks under RBI\u2019s purview, is the best approach to deal with the issue of dual control in an impactful manner."

    "instruction": "Answer the question based on the provided context from the financial report.",
    "input": "Question: What is dual control of Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs)?",
    "output": "Dual control of cooperative banks, specifically UCBs, has been extensively discussed in reports from various committees. These banks are cooperative societies registered under either the State Cooperative Societies Act or the Multi-State Cooperative Societies Act of 2002, which typically cover incorporation, regulation, and winding up. Because these societies engage in banking, they require licensing under the Banking Regulation (BR) Act, making them subject to dual regulation. Initially, certain BR Act provisions, particularly those concerning management, governance, audit, reconstructions, amalgamation, and winding up, were not applied to cooperative banks. Instead, these aspects were governed by cooperative societies laws, complicating regulation. This dual control hindered RBI's ability to improve UCB management and governance, as it lacked authority over delinquent board members. Cooperative banks, unlike other cooperatives, deal with money, yet cooperative society laws treat all types of cooperatives similarly. Given the complex and dynamic environment UCBs operate in, requiring specialized expertise, the dual regulation system presents challenges. It prevents the necessary professionalism at the board/management level, and forces the RBI to seek state/central authorities for actions like superseding boards or handling mergers, which is further complicated by differing state laws."

    "input": "Question: What challenges arose from the dual regulation of UCBs, and how did amendments to the BR Act address these issues?",
    "output": "UCBs carrying on business in more than one state or that of a single-state UCB with a multi -state UCB faced challenges under dual regulation. Similarly, framing a scheme for revival of a weak UCB or winding up of a non-viable UCB fell under the domain of the respective state/Central authorities, and RBI could not take timely action in such cases, thereby affecting effective resolution of the UCBs concerned. Several attempts to mitigate the challenges arising out of dual regulation were made through non-legislative changes such as the institution of TAFCUB. However, most of the challenges could not be addressed through these steps as the success of these frameworks depended on constructive voluntarism and cooperation. In this backdrop, the recent amendment to the BR Act has conferred greater regulatory powers upon the RBI to regulate hitherto off-limit areas of functioning of UCBs. It is expected that the BR Act provisions related to management now made applicable to UCBs will enable improvement in the quality of their management and the standards of their co-operative governance. Nevertheless, it is pertinent to note that although these amendments have reduced the extent of duality of control to a great extent, it has not been fully eliminated as the state/Central Government authorities continue to have concurrent powers on several aspects of functioning of UCBs for which appropriate consultation and co-ordination will be required between them and the RBI. A well-coordinated regulatory approach will, however, go a long way in ensuring a financially sound and well-managed UCB sector."

    "output": "Besides dual control, UCBs face several other constraints:\n\ni) Heterogeneity: There's a high degree of heterogeneity among UCBs in terms of size, area of operation, and geographical distribution. Almost 82% of the total UCBs and around 90% branches of all UCBs are concentrated in the Western and Southern regions of the country. Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Karnataka account for two-thirds of the total number of UCBs. UCBs are registered under different statutes of the states/centre based on their area of operation.\n\nii) Level of Technology Adoption: The present level of technology adoption in UCBs, particularly the medium and smaller ones, is low. This hinders their competitiveness against other financial institutions. Most UCBs face challenges in allocating scarce financial resources for IT due to high CAPEX and OPEX.\n\niii) Quality of Human Resources: Smaller UCBs find it difficult to attract talent, resulting in poorer quality of human resources. Non-standardized recruitment processes and a lack of training contribute to a skills gap. UCBs fail to attract desired talent because of far flung locations, low salary structures and not-so-good career prospects."

    "output": "Stakeholders highlighted that the regulatory regime for UCBs, compared to UNBs and SFBs, has been largely restrictive. The primary concerns were lower group exposure limits, lower exposure limits for housing loans, real estate, and commercial real estate, ceilings on total unsecured loans as well as individual unsecured loans, and restrictions on bullet repayment on gold loans. Certain SFB-like provisions, such as priority sector targets and prescriptions for loan ticket size, have been applied to UCBs, restricting their business expansion. Additionally, UCBs are generally excluded from government interest subsidy/subvention schemes, although they are included in schemes for MSMEs and export credit. Avenues for earning non-interest income are limited due to ceilings on non-SLR investments, and UCBs are not allowed to engage in government agency business. Restrictive criteria for payment system membership, internet/mobile banking facilities, and engaging Business Correspondents/Facilitators (BC/BF) have constrained digital banking and led to customer loss. Unlike SFBs and UNBs, UCBs require prior RBI approval for branch expansion, off-site ATMs, branch shifting, and preference share issuance. The lack of powers to write-off or settle sticky NPAs also hinders UCBs from cleaning their balance sheets. The Committee agreed that UCBs have a very important role to play in the financial landscape of the country."

    "output": "The Committee concluded that the regulatory approach and the inability of the UCBs to scale up their operating methods have contributed to the less than satisfactory performance of the sector. The Committee observed that the amendments to the BR Act now give an opportunity to RBI to strengthen the lines of defence in UCBs, viz. governance and audit. It also gives more avenues to UCBs to strengthen their capital base and additional tools for voluntary and involuntary resolution that could be largely non-disruptive. Therefore, the current regulatory template needs to be and can be reviewed. The RBI has more regulatory comfort arising from the additional powers vested in it and, therefore, could consider giving certain relaxations in business side of the regulations to enable UCBs to grow further. It was further agreed that the regulatory approach has to be so designed as to provide a framework for the financially strong UCBs to grow while remaining as a co-operative entity. At the same time, considering the fact that the banks are dealing with the public deposits, the principles have to be interpreted in a manner that they support the interests of the larger body of the depositors and the banks are run in an efficient manner for their own stability and in the interest of depositors. While the concerns in respect of smaller UCBs were appreciated, it was felt that in view of their operations being closer to co-operative principles, this strength should be harnessed while at the same time using the instrumentality of the Umbrella Organisation to acquire scale through network and thereby alleviate the concerns and constraints arising from their size. It is in the above background that the recommendations of the Committee as outlined in the following chapters, should be seen."

    "output": "Co-operative Banks, also referred to as financial co-operatives (FC), are significant players in the financial system of many countries across the world. Co-operative financial institutions originated in Germany, with the first urban credit co-operative founded in 1850. These institutions were designed as self-help institutions based on the principle of mutuality for encouraging the members to pool their financial resources and allow borrowals by the needy. Friedrich Wilhelm Raiffeisen formed the first rural credit co-operative in 1864. The model quickly spread to other countries in Europe, such as Austria, Italy, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Spain, Finland, Sweden, and Great Britain.\nAt the beginning of the 20th Century, the financial co-operative concept spread from Europe to North America. The first FC (caisse populaire) was established in 1900 in Canada by Alphonse Desjardins who went on to set up a further 150 FCs over the next fifteen years and helped establish the first US credit co-operative in 1908. The model kept on spreading around the world as an alternative to banks in the corporate sector during the remainder of the 20th Century.\nThe FCs are assigned different names in different jurisdictions such as Credit Unions or Caisses, Mutuals, Co-operative Banks, Rural Banks, or Community Banks. The institutional structure, legal and regulatory status, product offerings, and business models vary across countries, especially between advanced and emerging economies. For example, credit unions/caisse populaires are not-for-profit entities and provide services to members. Shinkin banks of Japan are also structured as not-for-profit entities and restrict loans to members while accepting deposits from non-members. In some countries, village-level credit societies may neither be regulated nor allowed to seek public deposits. Further, there are employees\u2019 thrift and credit co-operatives which are not banks and are not regulated. As at the end of 2019, in Europe there were 2683 co-operative banks operating through 42521 branches with aggregate assets of \u20ac7 trillion. Co-operative banks in countries like France, the Netherlands, Germany, Austria, Denmark, and Finland are an important source of funding for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).\nThe market presence of co-operative banks/ financial co-operatives varies significantly across jurisdictions, from marginal to dominant. In some countries, their presence is dominant (e.g., France, the Netherlands), while they are not so dominant in some countries, and in yet others, they are marginal players. For example, the share of co-operatives was less than 1 percent of the financial systems' total assets in South Africa whereas the share of co-operative banks was nearly half the country\u2018s financial assets in France.

    "output": "In Germany, cooperative banks face the same licensing requirements as commercial banks. The subscribed capital of cooperative banks consists of member shares, which are the only Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) instruments issued. These banks may also issue Additional Tier 1 capital instruments. There has been a significant reduction in the number of German cooperative banks, from about 7000 in 1970 to approximately 900 currently.\n\nIn France, cooperative banks must belong to a central body affiliated with the French Association of Credit Institutions and Investment Firms. There are three major cooperative banking groups: Groupe Cr\u00e9dit Agricole, Groupe Banques Populaires-Caisses d\u2019Epargne (BPCE), and Groupe Cr\u00e9dit Mutuel, along with four networks: Cr\u00e9dit Agricole, Banques Populaires, Caisses d\u2019Epargne, and Cr\u00e9dit Mutuel. These groups are structured as pyramids, with member-owned financial cooperatives at the base owning the central institution at the summit. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole SA is publicly listed, while Cr\u00e9dit Mutuel's central body is a not-for-profit association. Together, these groups account for 47% of French banking system assets, 51% of loans, and 47% of deposits. Two of the groups are designated as globally systemically important banking groups (G-SIBs), and all three are deemed significant banks under ECB supervision.\n\nThe capital of French financial cooperatives includes membership shares (capital shares) and financial reserves, with distribution limited by legislation. Membership shares can qualify as CET1 capital if they meet specific criteria. Since 1999, both commercial and cooperative banks in France belong to a common deposit guarantee scheme (Fonds de Garantie des D\u00e9p\u00f4ts et de R\u00e9solution or FGDR), funded by mandatory contributions from members, a prerequisite for licensing. Each cooperative group/network has its own liquidity support arrangements and solidarity mechanisms."

    "output": "In the Dutch economy, co-operative banks play a major role in the agricultural and horticultural sector. In the late 19th century, co-operative banks were founded in rural areas of the Netherlands to provide farmers with cheap loans. They later evolved into local banks, and their need for a mutual support system led to the formation of two central institutions: Co\u00f6peratieve Centrale Raiffeisen-Bank and Co\u00f6peratieve Centrale Boerenleenbank. These two institutions merged in 1972 into Rabobank. Thus, the co-operative banking system in the Netherlands is characterized by a high level of consolidation in the form of the Rabobank Group as the apex entity.\n\nRabobank Group consists of 86 member banks (also co-operatives, each licensed as a credit institution), their central organization Rabobank Nederland (also a co-operative entity and licensed as a credit institution), and their subsidiaries and other affiliated entities. Rabobank Nederland acts as an apex co-operative to the local member banks. The members of the local banks are drawn from customers but do not make any capital contributions to the banks. The management/supervisory Boards of the local banks are elected from the members. Member banks are geographically organized into 12 Regional Delegate Assemblies (RDAs), and a Central Delegate Assembly (CDA) of the Rabobank is constituted from the RDAs. There are Local Members\u2019 Councils at the member bank level and a General Members' Council at the Apex level (which is a body made up of delegates of the Members appointed by the Local Members' Councils). The General Members\u2019 Council Meetings approve annual financial statements, changes in Articles of Association, and elect the Supervisory Board of Rabobank Nederland. Voting rights of member banks are in proportion to a formula based on balance sheet totals, Tier-1 banking capital, and commercial results. At the apex level, the co-operative principle of \u2018one member one vote\u2019 does not apply.\n\nRabobank does not have shareholders, but over two million members, and dividend payments are not made to members. It has a Bankers\u2019 Bank role (regulating the deficits and surpluses of member banks) and a Services role (support in the development of products and services, payment systems, advice, legal assistance, knowledge dissemination, and co-ordination of policies). In addition to this, it has a supervisory role with responsibility for monitoring operations, integrity, outsourcing, solvency, and liquidity of the member banks), which has been entrusted under law. The appointment of MDs of member banks has to be approved by Rabobank, and it can appoint an additional director having veto rights on the Board of member banks.

Co-operatives banks in Europe developed central institutions and formed network associations. The level of integration varies from the centralization of common services viz. strategic advice, basic support services etc. to more complex functions viz. risk and liquidity management, mergers and acquisitions etc. Wherever the FCs are strong and compete with the commercial banks, particularly in respect of small customers, such as in France, the Netherlands, Germany, Italy, Austria, Spain, Finland, they work under highly integrated and centralized systems. Delegation is lesser in case of Austrian and German co-operative banks, while Italian and Spanish co-operative banks are almost entirely decentralized.\nIn Canada, Desjardins Caisses Populaire operate as a complex federated model. The individual caisse are independent and autonomously incorporated entities, but operate in a structured, standardized and closely inter -connected environment. In US, credit unions have formed Credit Union Services Organizations (CUSOs) which are limited liability companies to facilitate shared services.\nBusiness model diversity has been observed within the co -operative financial institutions across the jurisdictions. Canadian credit unions are found to operate on any one of the three models followed in the country of which two are retail -oriented with different levels of diversification (focused retail and diversified retail) and one is investment -oriented which includes trading and derivatives. US credit unions operate retail -oriented business model. Co -operative banks in Europe operate one of five business models. Three of these are characterized as being retail -oriented, a fourth wholesale focused and a fifth investment driven. In Japan, Shinkin banks adopt two forms of business model, which concentrate on the issuance of loans funded by deposits (traditional) and the investment and management of large investment portfolios (new). Business model types differ in terms of their risk appetite and profit potential.\nVariations in board constitution observed across some of the jurisdictions are as under:\ni) Credit Agricole has a three-tier indirect system of governance.

    "input": "Question: What are some examples of proportionality in regulation for cooperative banks across different jurisdictions, particularly focusing on capital adequacy, liquidity, reporting requirements, and provisioning rules?",
    "output": "Proportionality in regulation is considered an important factor in the context of sustainability of co-operative banks. Most jurisdictions practice some sort of proportionality. \n\ni) In all countries, the regulatory prescriptions regarding governance, processes and systems are higher with respect to large and more sophisticated financial institutions. The main tool of regulation being capital adequacy, proportionality is often seen in capital and liquidity adequacy ratios. In some countries smaller institutions are given concessions in capital ratio and Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR). In France and Germany (and more generally EU countries), Basel III standards apply, in general, to all financial institutions regardless of their size and complexity. Both Basel II and Basel III norms advocate Internal Risk Based Assessment which ultimately leads to proportionality.\nii) Proportionality in prudential regulation usually takes the form of simpler but not necessarily lighter requirements as proportionality does not necessarily mean a lower capital ratio. Also risk weights are commonly calibrated to a higher level to compensate for the fact that several other components of risk are not reckoned. \niii) Several countries exempt small financial institutions from compliance to the LCR and the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR). Instead, they stipulate a simple liquidity requirement at a given percentage to total assets or deposits. In Ireland, co-operative banks are required to maintain a minimum liquidity ratio of 20 per cent of their unattached savings in liquid assets. In Kenya, at least 15 per cent of total savings deposits must be held in the form of liquid assets.\niv) Reporting requirements can also be proportional. In Brazil, small financial institutions are exempted from Pillar 3 disclosure (information relating to their risks, capital adequacy, and policies for managing risk with the aim of promoting market discipline) requirements. In South Africa, large FCs are required to submit monthly returns while smaller ones report on a quarterly basis. \nv) Given the relative complexity in accounting rules under IRAC norms, some countries have come up with a simplified or automatic approach to provisioning. In Australia, Kenya and South Africa, number of days in default is the main input for determining the provisioning rate. In Ireland under Financial Reporting Standard, co-operative banks need to follow an incurred loss approach to provisioning.\nvi) The measurement of capital differs among countries. In Ireland and the United States where capital is mainly made up of retained earnings, member shares are not eligible for regulatory capital because they are redeemable and are therefore considered to be liabilities. In Kenya, member shares may count as regulatory capital, but they cannot be redeemed. In European Countries, member shares are considered as part of capital. In most of the countries, member share is not transferable and can only be redeemed at face value."

    "input": "Question: What are the major factors that constrained the effective regulation of Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), and how has the regulatory framework addressed these constraints?",
    "output": "Effective regulation of UCBs by RBI was constrained by two major factors: a lack of adequate regulatory control of RBI over UCBs due to statutory limitations, and vast heterogeneity amongst the UCBs in terms of size, scale, complexity of business, etc. The extant regulatory framework for UCBs is the outcome of RBI\u2019s assessment of how, within these constraints, the UCB sector can be allowed to function without much adverse impact on depositor safety and systemic stability. The recent amendments to the Banking Regulation (BR) Act took effect in June 2020 for UCBs. The provisions of the BR Act applicable to UCBs till then did not include several important areas of their functioning, such as management, share capital, audit, resolution, etc. These areas have been regulated by the State Governments under the provisions of the respective State Co-operative Societies\u2019 laws and by the Central Government under the provisions of the Multi-State Co-operative Societies Act, 2002 (for UCBs whose area of operation extends to more than one State). Most of these legislations did not have appropriate provisions for effectively regulating these co-operative societies as banks. Keeping in view the gaps and constraints, efforts have been made to contain the systemic risk in the sector and enhance their aspirations for further growth. The High-Powered Committee (HPC) on UCBs chaired by Shri. R. Gandhi recommended in 2015 that UCBs with a business size of more than \u20b920,000 crore may be converted into joint stock banks and suggested restricting the unrestrained growth of large UCBs. The HPC also recommended that there may be an option for other large UCBs to voluntarily convert into Small Finance Banks (SFBs) provided they fulfil the eligibility criteria."

    "input": "Question: What key provisions are now applicable to UCBs due to the amendments to the BR Act, and what are the committee's views and recommendations regarding these changes, potential conversion to joint stock companies, and parallel statutory provisions?",
    "output": "Important provisions of the Act which have now become applicable to UCBs include restriction on whole time directors of UCBs from having substantial interest / employment in other companies/firms, qualification criteria for members of the board, requirement of prior approval for appointment / re -appointment / termination of appointment of Managing Director (MD) / Whole Time Director (WTD)/Chairman, removal of Chairman / MD / Chief Executive Officer / Directors, supersession of the board of UCBs, issue of share capital and securities by UCBs, regulation of refund of share capital by UCBs, powers to sanction voluntary amalgamations of UCBs, power to prepare scheme for compulsory amalgamation and reconstruction of UCBs and power to approve appointment / removal of statutory auditors.\n\nIn the Committee\u2019s view, while it was possible that the structural factors arising from the co-operative character underlying the UCBs could still pose some challenges, the amendments to the BR Act address to a large extent the gaps in the legislative framework, which informed the extant approach of the RBI towards regulation and supervision of UCBs. Consequently, since the UCBs have the potential of driving financial inclusion and credit delivery to those with limited means, the regulatory policies can now be more enabling. At the same time, there were divergent views on allowing the UCBs to convert into joint stock companies. One view was that conversion of UCBs into banking companies is against the co -operative principles as the retained earnings in co-operative structure cannot be distributed. A contrary view was that voluntary conversion after a well -informed decision taken by the General Body of the UCB in a democratic manner should not be barred by regulation, particularly where the underly ing legislation is not restrictive on the use of retained earnings. Incidentally, it was also observed that a few co -operative laws such as the Multi-State Co-operative Societies Act, 2002 and Maharashtra Co-operative Societies Act, 1960 do facilitate distribution of surplus assets to shareholders during liquidation of the co -operative society. The Committee, therefore, recommends the continuation of the existing regulatory neutrality in regard to the voluntary conversion of co-operative banks to joint stock companies as per the operating framework in place therefor.\n\nThe Committee also discussed the issue of parallel statutory provisions in the BR Act and the co-operative societies\u2019 laws, which was raised by UCBs and their federations during their interaction with the Committee. These are considered more to be administrative challenges rather than legislative conflicts. The Committee recommends that to obviate difficulties for UCBs due to jurisdictional issues between the RBI and the concerned Registrars of Co-operative Societies (RCS) / Central Registrar of Co -operative Societies (CRCS), RBI may consider clarifying the position appropriately to the concerned authorities."

    "input": "Question: What are some key differences observed among Urban Co-operative Banks (UCBs) in terms of size, operations, and member orientation?",
    "output": "The Committee observed that the UCBs are highly heterogeneous in terms of size, scale, complexity of business, etc. As on March 31, 2020, the largest UCB in the sector had deposits of around \u20b938,000 crore, whereas the average deposit size of the bottom 100 UCBs was about \u20b95 crore. In terms of branch network, as on March 31, 2020, there were about 550 Unit UCBs (having a single office-cum-branch), whereas the largest UCB had 285 branches. There is also a sizeable difference in the cooperativeness and aspirations of the UCBs in the sector. It has been observed that as the UCBs grow, the commonality amongst the members, which is the cornerstone of co-operative societies, declines and the commercial interests start taking over. A study confirmed this understanding, observing that around 47 per cent of the deposits in the smaller UCBs (deposits up to \u20b910 crore) were held by its members, while it was only around 30 per cent in the larger UCBs (deposits more than 1000 crore). The smaller UCBs are more member-oriented and have limited aspirations, evident from the fact that many are single-branch banks despite being in existence for a long time. On the other hand, the larger UCBs expressed their intentions to grow their areas of operation, give larger loans, and undertake activities on par with commercial banks, during the course of the interaction with the Committee."

    "output": "There is a need for scale-based or proportionate regulation within the UCB sector because UCBs are highly heterogeneous in terms of size, scale, and complexity of business. A tiered regulatory framework with more than two tiers is required to balance the spirit of mutuality and cooperation more prevalent in banks of smaller sizes and those with limited area of operation vis-\u00e0-vis the growth ambitions of the large sized UCBs to spread their area of operation and undertake more complex business activities on par with commercial banks. Deposit size can continue to be the basis for categorizing banks into regulatory tiers, as for a normally functioning bank, deposit size can broadly serve as proxy for capital size and net worth. Furthermore, additional tiers could be created to cater to the aspirations of the larger UCBs to undertake business akin to SFBs and UNBs. A questionnaire circulated among all UCBs and their Federations revealed that 92% of the responses were in favor of scale-based differential regulation, with 78% indicating deposit size as the preferred parameter to categorize banks."

    "instruction": "Answer the question based on the provided context from the financial report.",
    "input": "Question: What is proportionate regulation, and how is it applied in banking regulatory frameworks?",
    "output": "Proportionate regulation in the banking sector involves tailoring regulations based on an entity's systemic importance, complexity, and riskiness, to avoid excessive compliance costs, especially for smaller or non-complex entities, which may inadvertently impact their competitive standing. Instead of applying proportional regulation for each variation in size and complexity, entities are grouped into categories, and applicable proportional regulation is applied to all entities within that category. Two common models for establishing proportionality are:\n\na) Categorization approach for proportionality (CAP): Establishing categories of entities according to different characteristics and applying a specific regulatory regime to each.\nb) Specific standard approach for proportionality (SSAP): Establishing criteria for the application of specific requirements for a subset of prudential standards.\n\nDeveloped financial markets like the USA and Europe have adopted proportionate regulation to varying extents. In the USA, certain banks are subject to Basel III requirements based on asset size and foreign exposure, while the European Union largely applies Basel III to nearly all banks, with some exceptions for smaller banks.\n\nIn India, the regulatory framework for banks has largely followed proportionate regulations based on type and size. UCBs operate under a differential and simpler regulatory framework compared to UNBs, such as being governed by Basel I capital framework instead of Basel III. StCBs/ DCCBs, RRBs, SFBs, and Payment Banks also have simplified regulatory frameworks. The regulatory approach has been uniform for a particular type of banking entity, but the heterogeneity in the sector has created a situation of regulatory arbitrage for the larger UCBs, which operate under simpler guidelines despite their high level of operations."

    "output": "From the charts, it can be observed that UCBs in Group 1 (based on total deposits) had a higher average Net Interest Margin (NIM) (\u22483.75 per cent), whereas UCBs in Group 4 had a relatively lower average NIM (\u22482.50  per cent), thereby indicating a reduction in NIM as UCBs increase in size. However, it can also be observed that the higher NIM in smaller UCBs did not result in a correspondingly higher RoA for them. The key reasons for low RoA in smaller UCBs can be attributed to their higher Cost to Income Ratio and Gross Non-Performing Assets (GNPA) when compared with larger UCBs. It can be argued that the higher Cost-to-Income ratio and NPA ratios of smaller UCBs were due to their lack of economies of scale and poor credit management, which can ultimately be attributed to their smaller size. Further, it is also observed from the data that once UCBs come under financial stress, smaller UCBs have higher likelihood of failing to improve themselves, leading to cancellation of their license."

    "output": "The Committee deliberated on whether there should be a prescription for minimum capital and reserve (net worth) requirement for UCBs irrespective of CRAR, with divergent views among members. One view favored the status quo, noting the long history of smaller UCBs surviving and serving customers despite their size, with around 300 UCBs having deposits of less than \u20b925 crores that would find it difficult to augment their capital and reserves beyond a point. The other view observed the shift in the financial services industry towards technology-enabled services and skilled manpower, requiring sustained growth to remain relevant. Small UCBs face competition from larger lenders with better technology, and their small size could threaten their survival, as evidenced by financial stress in many small UCBs. Maintaining the status quo could lead to the failure of many small UCBs, harming depositors and stakeholders and negatively impacting the perception of the UCB sector. The Committee agreed that a minimum capital and reserve (net worth) with a reasonable time period to achieve the same could be suggested."

Area of operation extends to the entire country for UNBs and SFBs while area of operation of RRBs is fixed. For priority sector lending targets, UCBs are to achieve 75 per cent of Adjusted Net Bank Credit (ANBC) by March 31, 2024, while UNBs, SFBs and RRBs have a target of 40 per cent, 75 per cent and 75 per cent of ANBC respectively.

    "output": "Regarding inclusion under the Second Schedule to the RBI Act, 1934:\n*   **UCBs:** Prior approval route; UCBs fulfilling prescribed criteria are eligible to apply.\n*   **UNBs:** Prior approval route; all new SCBs after commencement of operations are eligible to apply.\n*   **SFBs:** Prior approval route; all new SFBs after commencement of operations are eligible to apply.\n*   **RRBs:** Prior approval route; newly amalgamated RRBs are Scheduled by RBI on the basis of a certificate issued by NABARD.\n\nThe Committee observed that while UNBs and SFBs have considerable freedom to undertake their business activities and decide their own sectoral exposure limits, the lack of even elementary risk management capability in the majority of the UCBs does not allow RBI to adopt a similar regulatory approach for UCBs. At the same time, the lack of investor interest emanating from the absence of proportionate voting rights is a major constraint faced by RBI in the resolution of financially distressed UCBs. Seemingly due to the above reasons, RBI adopts a calibrated regulatory approach for mitigating various risks in the case of UCBs by prescribing sectoral limits / monetary ceilings for different categories of loans, as also the requirement of prior approval for expansion of branches and area of operation. The Committee felt that a liberal regulatory approach may be adopted for UCBs that meet a certain minimum level of capital and reserves (net worth) and CRAR requirements. Further, membership of the UO might also provide extra comfort to the regulator as the smaller UCBs would benefit from the products and services provided by the UO. It was felt that UCBs meeting the criteria specified for UNBs or SFBs and having comparable risk management abilities may be regulated on the lines of UNBs or SFBs, as the case may be. At the same time, the Committee was of the opinion that a comparison of UCBs with RRBs may not be justifiable given that the latter primarily operates in rural areas and has little scope for expansion of area of operation.\nWith regard to the existing regulatory approach of prescribing sectoral limits / monetary ceilings for UCBs, the Committee believed that given the heterogeneity in the sector, the monetary ceilings on different categories of loans may be dispensed, particularly for the larger UCBs. Instead, the Committee felt, the regulatory ceilings may be defined as a percentage of Tier I capital of the bank, with appropriate monetary ceilings for smaller UCBs having inadequate risk management and risk-bearing capacity. For larger UCBs, the monetary ceilings may be decided by their Boards, within the prescribed general exposure limits (for single/group borrowers)."

However, a higher level of CRAR needs to be prescribed to address market and operational risks, especially if operational freedom is enhanced. The Committee also considered that membership in a UO would mitigate these risks for lower-tier UCBs to some extent, potentially allowing the CRAR requirement to be lowered, provided a glide path is offered to achieve the higher CRAR."

    "output": "For Tier 1 and Tier 2 UCBs, modifications are recommended to give more operational freedom, subject to banks meeting the suggested regulatory requirement of CRAR and net worth. Regarding housing loans, the maximum limit may be prescribed as a percentage of Tier 1 capital, subject to RBI prescribed ceiling for Tier 1 UCBs (but higher than the present ceiling) and respective Board of Directors-approved ceiling for Tier 2 UCBs. For Tier 2 UCBs, the risk weight on housing loans may be prescribed based on size of the loan and loan-to-value (LTV) ratio, in line with SCBs. The maximum limit on loan against gold ornaments extended on bullet repayment terms may be prescribed as a percentage of Tier 1 capital, subject to suitable LTV ratio. There may be an RBI prescribed ceiling (higher than the present ceiling) for Tier 1 UCBs and respective Board of Directors-approved ceiling for Tier 2 UCBs. For banks in Tier 1 and 2, the maximum limit on individual unsecured loans may be linked to Tier I capital, subject to a suitable upper cap for Tier 1 banks. Tier 2 banks may have a Board-approved ceiling. The present aggregate limit on unsecured advances, i.e., 10 per cent of total assets may continue. However, the UCBs may be allowed to have a higher limit with the approval of their Boards and subject to the condition that the loans exceeding the aforesaid 10 per cent limit must qualify to be classified as PSL. For UCBs in Tier 2, the limit on exposure to various sectors may be removed on par with other banks. However, to mitigate the concentration risk (coupled with geographical concentration risk), additional standard asset provisioning may be imposed on exposure to a single sector beyond a specified percentage of the loan portfolio (say 20 percent)."

RBI should enforce the new BR Act provisions regarding Governance and implement a toolkit of regulatory responses. \n\nComputation of Tier I Capital: Revaluation Reserve may be included in Tier I capital, subject to applicable discounts similar to scheduled commercial banks. \n\nInclusion in Government Sponsored Schemes: UCBs should be included as eligible banks under Government Schemes like MUDRA and interest subvention/subsidy schemes. They should also be allowed to undertake Government business if they meet the prescribed criteria.\n\nUmbrella Organization (UO): RBI granted 'in-principle' approval to NAFCUB in June 2019 to establish a UO as a non-deposit-taking NBFC, with regulatory forbearance related to investment in shares and ceilings on non-SLR investments. The UO would provide HR, IT, and financial support to members, service member UCBs, and interface with mainstream finance. It is also expected to provide value-added services such as treasury, forex, international remittances, credit and debit cards, insurance, social-security, and pension products. UCBs can leverage the UO's technological capabilities through shared computing and cloud-based technology services. Future technological infrastructure changes can be managed at the UO level, reducing unit costs for UCBs."

Financial co-operatives would use most of the services of the UO, while non-financial co-operatives could use specific services such as wallet services, cash management services, and access to payments and remittance systems. Member contributions may be in the nature of share capital. The UO should be a financially strong organization with adequate capital and a viable business plan, having a minimum capital of \u20b9300 crore with regulatory stipulations. Once stabilized, it may explore converting into a universal bank and offer value-added services. In the medium term, it may take up the role of a Self-Regulatory Organization (SRO) and should be evaluated for quality of internal controls. The UO can identify training needs of the staff and directors of its member banks and train them. Finally, once the Certificate of Registration (COR) is issued and the UO commences its business, RBI could consider providing a one-time grant for a specific objective, tied to providing IT support to its member banks."

    "input": "Question: Why is capital augmentation important for UCBs?",
    "output": "Banking, unlike other businesses, is a highly leveraged business involving acceptance of deposits from the public without any security. Debt-Equity ratio of banks can be as high as 15:1 or even more, as against other businesses where it generally does not exceed 3:1. While it is for these reasons that banking is among the most regulated businesses globally, the availability of capital in conformity with the regulatory requirements and ability to augment it as and when needed is critical for idiosyncratic and system stability. The regulatory capital requirement is articulated through the global standards set by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and enshrined in the legislative framework. Capital is needed for sustenance as well as growth. A bank having very low level of capital may not be able to mobilize deposits beyond a certain point, affecting its growth and exposing depositors to higher risk. Adequate capital enhances the ability to bear shocks from financial stress and enables a bank to absorb unforeseen losses while continuing to grow. Capital is also needed for adoption of modern banking technology, such as CTS, ATM, Debit/Credit Cards, Payment System Infrastructure, Data Analytics, and MIS, which are capital intensive investments."

    "output": "The bare minimum capital (paid-up capital and reserves having real and exchangeable value) required for a co-operative bank to commence and carry on banking business is prescribed in the BR Act 25. This minimum capital was set at \u20b91 lakh in 1965. While the capital requirement as per the entry point norms (EPN) for universal commercial banks is \u20b9500 crore, and that for small finance banks is \u20b9200 crore, for a general category UCB at an \u2018A\u2019 centre (> 10 lakh population), the initial capital requirement is only \u20b94 crore. This requirement is \u20b92 crore for a \u2018B\u2019 centre (population 5-10 lakh), \u20b91 crore for a \u2018C\u2019 centre (population 1 -5 lakh) and \u20b925 lakh for a \u2018D\u2019 centre (population < 1 lakh population). For specialised UCBs (viz., banks organised as unit banks, banks organised by Mahilas/SC/STs and banks organised in less developed states/North Eastern states/Tribal regions), the entry point capital ranges between \u20b98.33 lakh to \u20b93 crore depending on the population of the centre. These norms were prescribed 21 years ago. Since then, though the deposits of UCBs have grown multif old, no revision in the minimum entry point capital requirements has been made."

    "output": "Capital requirements should be designed to ensure that the bank can withstand the risks faced in the banking business, irrespective of the geographical area or membership constitution. Differentiation should only be based on the size of operations. Apart from the minimum capital requirements as entry point norms, RBI has prescribed minimum CRAR for UCBs, which currently stands at 9 per cent of the risk-weighted assets. Presently, CRAR is calculated taking into account the credit risk of UCBs, as Basel I norms have been applied to UCBs, irrespective of their size of operations, except for AD Category-I UCBs which have to maintain capital for market risk as well. As on March 31, 2020, there were about 80 UCBs which did not have even the minimum CRAR prescribed."

    "output": "Most co-operative banks are organized based on community, regional, or ethnic affiliations, and membership with voting rights are held on those lines. The bylaws accordingly provide for the class of persons who are eligible to become shareholders of a co-operative bank. Therefore, the main source of share capital is through membership/share linkage. Borrowers who subscribe to shares of the UCB as a part of share-linkage tend to surrender the shares and seek a refund once the loan is repaid, as they do not have any long-term interest in investing in the co-operative bank. As such, capital raising through share-linkage may not be a feasible way of having sustainable and resilient share capital. Nevertheless, there have been instances, however rare, where certain individuals/groups have invested in the shares of co-operative banks on the appeal of the members of the society to tide over their capital adequacy requirements. Further, investments in shares by senior citizens who are attracted by the high dividends paid by some of the co-operative banks has also been an important source of capital for UCBs."

    "input": "Question: Why is the listing of securities issued by cooperative banks on recognized stock exchanges under the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act (SCRA) not legally possible, and what are the limitations regarding public and private placements for these banks?",
    "output": "Listing of securities issued by co-operative banks on recognised stock exchanges under SCRA would not be legally possible at this stage. Further, there is no scope of value appreciation of shares of co-operative banks through price discovery in the secondary market. The listing of a security provides a secondary market for the investors, leading to greater liquidity, but potential investors would then not be limited to only those who may want to hold the securities till maturity or for perpetuity.\n\nThe Committee is of the view that the recent amendments to the BR Act need to be supplemented by legislative enablement for listing of certain securities issued by the UCBs. As there is no corresponding law in the co-operative realm, it is difficult to categorise the issuance of securities made by co-operative banks into \u201cpublic offers\u201d and \u201cprivate placements\u201d in the manner these are known in case of companies. However, going by the principles of the Companies Act, such issuances can be categorised based on the intention of the issuer, that is, whether it is intended to be open for subscription by any person eligible under the co-operative law to subscribe to the shares of the co-operative society or whether it is intended to be subscribed by only those persons to whom the shares have been offered privately. Furthermore, considering the restrictions relating to area of operation, such public issues/private placements, though could be at premium, can only be made to persons residing within the area of operation of the bank. Considering the need for listing the securities issued by co -operative banks and given the constraints discussed, a suitable amendment could be made in the BR Act, enabling RBI, being the regulator and supervisor of the sector, to notify certain securities (shares or debenture or bonds) issued by any co-operative bank or class of co-operative banks as corporate."

    "output": "UCBs are permitted to issue the following instruments for augmenting their capital requirements: Tier I Capital includes Perpetual Non-Cumulative Preference Shares (PNCPS), and Innovative Perpetual Debt Instruments (IPDI) (for financial restructuring of weak UCBs). Tier II Capital includes Perpetual Cumulative Preference Shares (PCPS), Redeemable Non-Cumulative Preference Shares (RNCPS), Redeemable Cumulative Preference Shares (RCPS), and Long Term (Subordinated) Deposits (LTD). Though these options have been available for several years, there hasn't been much capital raising through these routes, with a few exceptions in the form of some banks accessing funds as LTDs, possibly due to the non-availability of a clear legal framework. It is expected that with the provisions of the BR Act and consequent issue of exhaustive guidelines from the RBI would reduce the above constraint significantly. Regarding Share Capital, issue of shares to the public and at premium has been allowed after the recent amendments to the BR Act, which should, in the future, be supported by amendments to the BR Act to facilitate listing of shares, thereby enabling transparent discovery of price and bri nging in requisite transparency. However, till such amendments are in place, RBI may consider allowing larger banks in Tier 3 and 4, having the necessary technology and wherewithal, to issue shares at premium to person residing in their areas of operation. The recommendations of the Committee are as under: i) Amendments to the BR Act for enabling RBI to notify through a Gazette Notification the classes of instruments as \"securities\" for the purpose of SCRA and SEBI Acts, to enable their listing and trading on stock exchanges. ii) Till such amendment comes into force, banks may be allowed to have a system on their websites facilitating buyers and sellers of shares to indicate their interests to buy / sell securities at book value, subject to the bank ensuring that the prospective buyer is eligible to be admitted as a member. iii) RBI may provide the broad mechanism for guidance of the banks to determine the valuation (book value) based on their last audited financial statement. iv) The statutory auditor of th e bank may be required to certify the book value of the shares as per RBI\u2019s directions. v) Eligible banks may be required to publish their financial statements more frequently (say, quarterly/half-yearly) for transparency.

Such contributing persons can become sympathizer members without voting rights as provided under Section 27 of the Maharashtra Co-operative Societies Act, 1960, resolving KYC verification issues. \n\nHowever, a counterview suggested that donations/grants-in-aid/contributions should be credited to the Profit and Loss Account as per accounting practices, with a portion transferred to reserves after income tax. Furthermore, eminent persons admitted as sympathizer members are not expected to contribute to share capital normally; if they do, they gain the same rights as ordinary members. \n\nThe Committee recommends exploring the feasibility of an alternate instrument, possibly Redeemable Preference Shares with a very low coupon rate and a 20-year maturity, to allow contributions without voting rights."

Over the years that followed, a large number of such small co -operative societies emerged as UCBs. However, licensing of such large number of entities with a nominal capital requirement and lack of professionalism led to proliferation of weak UCBs.

When the weak financial position of a UCB culminates in negative net worth and erosion of deposits, the framework envisages issue of Directions including \u201cAll -Inclusive Directions (AID)\u201d under Section 35A of the BR Act (AACS). Directions can also be issued on occurrence of other exceptional circumstances like run on a bank, reports of severe liquidity crunch, complaints of non-payment or preferential payment of deposits, market information regarding problems related to management, etc. Once AID is imposed on a bank, it has two alternatives \u2013 either to revive by way of fresh capital infusion and/ or by improving recoveries thereby improving its financial position or exit in a non-disruptive manner by voluntary merger with a stronger bank or conversion into a non -banking society.

One of the objectives of the Supervisory Action Framework (SAF) has been to eliminate negative net worth UCBs, which has not been achieved due to fresh slippages. Achieving this objective in its totality is difficult for several reasons: the continuous entry of UCBs into negative net worth territory, the inability of UCBs to swiftly raise capital, and delays in resolving weak UCBs while they are still solvent, making the resolution of negative net worth UCBs significantly more challenging."

    "output": "The committee makes several recommendations regarding the Supervisory Action Framework (SAF). First, additional provisioning suggested by Inspecting Officers (IOs) should be adjusted from GNPA to arrive at assessed NNPA, similar to adjustments in Tier I capital done to arrive at assessed CRAR. TAFCUB intervention may also be considered if the divergence is large, leading to a significant increase in NNPA and reduction in CRAR. Ideally, the SAF should be based on the single indicator of solvency, namely CRAR; however, due to inconsistencies at different levels of provision coverage ratio, a twin-indicator approach (NNPA and CRAR) is recommended for now, aiming for a time-bound remedy to financial stress. Actions under the SAF may continue to be segregated into mandatory and discretionary. Actions based on the twin indicators may be taken by the RBI without reference to TAFCUB. Banks with other supervisory concerns may be considered for discretionary action in consultation with TAFCUB for banks in Tiers 1 and 2. All-inclusive Directions should be treated on par with moratorium under Section 45 of BR Act and, if imposed, a bank should not continue thereunder beyond the time permitted to keep a bank under moratorium. Finally, the committee recommends a regulatory nudge for weak banks to explore voluntary merger or conversion into a non-banking society early on, with the understanding that mandatory resolution powers would be employed otherwise. RBI may also strive to begin the mandatory resolution process as soon as a UCB reaches Stage III under the SAF and consider superseding the Board if necessary."

The financial parameters relevant for the purpose of SAF for UCBs include capital (CRAR), asset quality (Net NPA) and profitability (Losses) . While capital is the backbone of a financial entity as it ensures its solvency, asset quality and profitability also assume significance as these determine the extent of accretion to or erosion in the capital.

    "input": "Question: Why might a single SAF indicator such as CRAR not work in isolation for UCBs, and how can adequacy of capital be assessed by taking into account weakness in other parameters such as Net NPA?",
    "output": "While formal intervention regimes cannot replace discretionary interventions based on regular supervisory powers, they provide useful backstops. The single indicator regime in USA is feasible apparently because of relatively high provision coverage ratio (PCR) of banks in that country. However, keeping in view the relatively low PCR in most UCBs, a single SAF indicator such as CRAR may not work in isolation even though it might be a preferred choice on account of it being objective, transparent, equitable and easy to administer. Therefore, adequacy of capital for the purpose will have to be assessed after taking into account the weakness in the other parameters, particularly Net NPA, as losses are already factored in CRAR, whereas NPA is factored only to the extent it has been provided for by the bank. Thus, for banks having high Net NPA, say, more than 6 per cent (which is the current SAF threshold), it will be desirable to ascertain the amount of capital erosion that will take place if banks make enough provision to bring down the Net NPA from its actual level to a uniform level of 6 per cent and calculate the CRAR after accounting for such erosion. In other words, the amount of additional provision required to bring down the Net NPA of the bank to 6 per cent may be reckoned for computing CRAR and the CRAR thus arrived at, say \u201c Derived CRAR\u201d, may be considered as the sole indicator under the SAF. Such Derived CRAR will be a uniform indicator across banks by pegging their Net NPAs at 6 per cent and as long as a bank continues to have Derived CRAR more than the prescribed minimum CRAR, it may not call for supervisory action under the SAF, notwithstanding the actual Net NPAs or losses. CRAR being the sole indicator will ensure that a well-capitalized bank will not be placed under SAF due to weakness in other parameters. Relying on CR AR without normalizing it for a given net NPA level could result in the CRAR becoming backward looking and delay supervisory intervention in case of banks that have a high level of un -provided NPAs. The more stringent actions are invariably linked to solve ncy and so long as a bank is solvent and is potentially solvent, the other deficiencies can be addressed outside the SAF through discretionary measures targeted at addressing the specific shortcoming(s)."

    "input": "Question: What is the role and efficacy of the Task Force on Urban Co-operative Banks (TAFCUB) and what suggestions have been made regarding its functions?",
    "output": "The Task Force on Urban Co-operative Banks (TAFCUB), comprising the Regional Director (RD) of the RBI, the Registrar of Co-operative Societies of the state concerned, and representatives from NAFCUB and the State Federation of the UCBs, has been instrumental for over a decade in identifying viable and non-viable UCBs. It suggests revival paths for viable UCBs and appropriate exit routes for non-viable ones.\n\nRecent amendments to the BR Act prompted a review of TAFCUB's agenda. Approximately 75 per cent of respondents suggested the current agenda was satisfactory. However, some UCBs proposed that TAFCUB should study early warning signals of UCBs heading towards the imposition of the Supervisory Action Framework (SAF). This would allow TAFCUB and the regulator to guide UCBs and involve the Unit Officer (UO) to prevent banks from reaching the SAF invocation stage, if commercially feasible. Concerns were also raised about TAFCUB's limited role after the introduction of SAF by RBI, with some banks suggesting that regulatory actions by RBI Regional Offices should align with TAFCUB decisions.\n\nThe committee deliberated on TAFCUB's role during or after a UCB is placed under SAF. It was decided that while mandatory actions based on objective criteria under SAF should be taken by RBI, TAFCUB could recommend discretionary actions to address financial or non-financial deficiencies in Tier 1 and 2 banks, such as high GNPA, losses, governance issues, inefficiencies, and weaknesses in systems and controls."

    "input": "Question: What was the impact of encouraging mergers on the consolidation of the UCB sector, and what trends have been observed in mergers and consolidations since 2003?",
    "output": "Encouraging mergers brought about a consolidation in the UCB sector to a certain degree. Since 2003, licenses of 385 UCBs have been cancelled, leading to either liquidation or merger with stronger banks, and despite the decrease in the number of UCBs, their combined asset size has continuously increased. From 2004-05 to March 2020, UCBs underwent 136 mergers, with Maharashtra accounting for more than half, followed by Gujarat. In the first five years after the issuance of the merger guidelines, 81 mergers took place, averaging 16.2 mergers per year; however, in the next ten years, the number decreased to 55, averaging 5.5 mergers per year. This decrease is attributed to the liberalized norms on the extension of area of operation and branch expansion in 2010, which led potential amalgamating UCBs to prefer organic growth over merging with weaker UCBs, as stated in section 8.9.1, RBI\u2019s Vision Document, 2005 put a brake on the liberal licensing policy while envisaging a multi-layered regulatory and supervisory strategy aimed at shoring up the viability of UCBs."

    "input": "Question: What factors correlate with mergers of UCBs, what role did RBI have in mergers before recent amendments to the BR Act, and what considerations are important for the sector's future?",
    "output": "There is a strong negative correlation between liberal regulation related to expansion of area of operation / branch network and mergers. Until the recent amendments to the BR Act, RBI was not empowered to formulate or approve a scheme for mergers/amalgamation of UCBs, as the same was under the domain of the respective Registrars of Co-operative Societies. The state governments had, however, incorporated in the respective Co -operative Societies\u2019 laws a provision for obtaining prior sanction, in writing from RBI for an order, inter alia, for sanctioning a scheme of amalgamation. RBI\u2019s examination of the proposals emanating from UCBs has been mainly confined to financial aspects, such as the interests of depositors as well as the stability of the financial system. The above arrangement made the resolution powers of RBI pertaining to UCBs inconsistent with those for commercial banks. As banking becomes more complex and the competition intense, the need for adequately skilled workforce increases, IT infrastructure needs to be enhanced and the cost of compliance goes up. The Committee felt that due to the heterogeneity, the sector needs some consolidation to achieve scale and remain relevant in the medium term. It further felt that the management of smaller UCBs should have long term vision and consider consolidation even as they may appear to be currently viable. Emergence of weak UCBs as reflected in the number of banks under SAF and AID is undermining the potential of the UCB sector to grow. The Committee noted that subsequent to the amendments in the BR Act, Master Direction has been issued by RBI in March 2021 for voluntary amalgamation of UCBs. With full powers for sanctioning mergers having come to RBI, unlike in the past when mergers had to be approved by both RBI and RCS, it is expected that the merger process will be smoother and faster."

    "output": "The following suggestions in general were received from stakeholders for improving growth prospects of the sector:\n\ni) Digital Banking services to customers at par with the commercial banks, need for a robust technical infrastructure and technical support in terms of technically skilled staff and training to the existing staff.\nii) Allow new licenses to banks, liberalise conditions for opening of new branches and extending area of operations.\niii) Relaxation in clearing house membership norms, permission for government business and various interest subsidy/subvention schemes being run by the government.\niv) Relaxation in the limits for loans and advances like housing loans, loans to nominal members, gold loans and liberalised exposure norms.\nv) Broadly, Federations suggested to allow new licenses to banks, relax prudential norms for internet banking and liberalise conditions for opening of new branches and extension of area of operation.\n\nThe Reserve Bank introduced various risk mitigating measures in the past to improve the resilience of the sector. With a view to allowing growth and expanding the range of product offerings, the concept of FSWM UCB was introduced to speed up the grant of regulatory approvals under the automatic route. Further, a slew of measures like sector and borrower-wise exposure norms, priority sectors lending targets, supervisory action framework to help weaker banks to rehabilitate themselves, infusing professionalism at the Board level, professionalizing the executive management by introducing BOM, etc. were also taken. In addition, measures were taken to improve the liquidity position of the UCBs, e.g., MSF for Scheduled UCBs. A majority of the respondents opined that these risks mitigation measures have been effective in improving the resilience of the sector to a large extent."

Some felt that increasing the priority sector lending target for UCBs from 40% to 75% was unreasonable. There were also opinions that the infusion of professional directors and the introduction of the Board of Management (BOM) had not yielded the desired level of professionalism or had created an overlap of functions. Furthermore, some respondents suggested relaxing financial parameter thresholds like NPA and CRAR to enable a better range of digital product offerings and advocated for professionalizing the Board itself instead of a separate BOM mechanism to improve governance standards. Other suggestions included extending MSF to all UCBs, irrespective of scheduled status, issuing guidelines on audit functions, providing a cost-effective technology platform, strengthening off-site surveillance, and capital/re-capitalization support from the RBI."

It was opined that any regulatory action by the RBI should be first discussed in the TAFCUB. For improving the functioning and efficacy of the TAFCUB mechanism, it was suggested that identifying incipient weaknesses at an early stage, even before the UCB is likely to come under the supervisory action framework, and discussing them in the TAFCUB can be one of the most proactive steps to improve the efficacy of the mechanism. At this stage, the intervention of the regulator and support from the proposed UO would significantly improve the resilience of the sector through the TAFCUB mechanism.

    "output": "Many UCBs welcomed the RBI\u2019s initiative in creating a UO for UCBs and suggested that regulatory incentives need to be offered by the RBI to banks for them to participate vigorously in its promotion. It was also suggested that the UO should have representatives from the concerned State Government, UCBs, the RBI and the Central Government. A majority of the UCBs suggested that the UO should have its branches at regional level so as to better understand the requirements of the UCBs in a particular region based on the regional situation. UCBs, particularly smaller ones, expected a low-cost technological platform, consultative services, short-term liquidity support, capacity building, etc. from the UO. UCBs, in general, suggested that the proposed UO should accept deposits from both scheduled and non-scheduled UCBs and pay market related interest rates. Further, it should also provide short term liquidity support at low cost against government securities. Some UCBs raised concerns regarding the efficacy of UO as UCBs are geographically scattered and catering to different communities. A few UCBs also mentioned that the larger UCBs might be commandeering the UO at the cost of the smaller UCBs. It was also apprehended that the UO might take unintended form and add an extra layer as another regulator. Federations suggested to treat deposits / shareholding of UCBs in the UO as eligible assets for Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) requirement."

Inference 1: The ratio of deposits up to \u20b95 lakh to total deposits (D/C%) showed an inverse relation with the amount of deposits held by UCBs. Further, for UCBs having deposits below \u20b9100 crore, about 30 percent of the deposits were not covered under DICGC insurance. Inference 2: The ratio of deposits held by members to total deposits held by the bank (E/C%) was less than 50 percent across the sample and generally had an inverse relation with the amount of deposits held by UCBs.

    "output": "The Urban Co-operative Banks (UCBs) are registered as co-operative societies under the state co-operative law / Multi-state co-operative societies Act and have been granted banking licence by the RBI under the provisions of BR Act, 1949. Thus, UCBs have been under the purview of two regulators viz. RCS/CRCS and RBI, giving rise to the issue of dual regulation. Further, prior to the enactment of the Banking Regulation (Amendment) Act, 2020, the RBI had limited powers relating to management of UCBs. Taking cognizance of this issue, the Expert Committee on Licensing of new UCBs (2011) headed by Shri Y.H. Malegam suggested segregation of the ownership of the UCB as a co-operative society from its functioning as a bank and proposed a new organisational structure consisting of Board of Management (BoM) in addition to Board of Directors (BoD). Under this structure, it was envisaged to infuse the desired professionalism at the policy making and decision -making levels in a UCB through BoM. It was further envisaged that RBI would exercise regulatory powers over BoM in a manner similar to BoD of a banking company. The High-Powered Committee (HPC) headed by Shri R. Gandhi also reiterated the need of BoM in UCBs. It, inter alia , recommended that constitution of the BoM should be a precondition for branch expansion and extending the area of operations of the UCBs.\n\nBased on the recommendations of the HPC and with due consultations with the stakeholders, the RBI issued guidelines on BoM in UCBs on December 31, 2019. The guidelines require UCBs (except all Salary Earners\u2019 Banks) with deposit size of \u20b9100 Crore and above to constitute BoM by making suitable amendments in their bye-laws, within one year of issuance of these guidelines. The BoM shall comprise of persons with special knowledge and practical experience in banking to facilitate professional management and focused attention to the banking related activities of the UCBs. Further, based on HPC\u2019s recommendation, constitution of BoM was made a mandatory requirement for allowing UCBs (except Salary Earners\u2019 Banks) with deposit size of \u20b9100 Crore and above, to expand their area of operation and open new branches. The members of BoM are required to have special knowledge or practical experience in respect of one or more of the matters viz. Accountancy, Agriculture and Rural Economy, Banking, Co -operation, Economics, Finance, Law, Small scale industry, Information Technology, any other subject, which would, in opinion of the RBI, be useful to the UCB. The RBI shall have powers to remove any member of BoM if the person is found to be not meeting the criteria prescribed by RBI or acting in a manner detrimental to the interests of the bank or its depositors or both. Further, the BoD shall seek concurrence from RBI before removing any member of the BoM / accepting the resignation"

    "output": "The Ways and Means Advances (WMA) Scheme of States is periodically reviewed after assessing the evolving economic and fiscal situation as well as the implications for monetary policy objectives. The 31st Conference of State Finance Secretaries held on March 18, 2019, had decided to set up a Committee to review the WMA scheme. Accordingly, the Reserve Bank had set up the Advisory Committee on WMA to State Governments in August 2019. The Committee comprised nine members, including the Chairman, Finance Secretaries of five State Governments representing each zone of Indian States, one member from PF-S, Ministry of Finance (MoF), Government of India (GoI), and an academic expert from the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy (NIPFP). Secretarial assistance and research support were provided to the Committee by the Internal Debt Management Department of the Reserve Bank of India. The Committee adopted a consultative approach and finalized its recommendations based on discussions held with member and non-member States and fiscal/monetary policy experts. Revision of WMA limits and review of Consolidated Sinking Fund (CSF) / Guarantee Redemption Fund (GRF) were also deliberated upon during the meetings of the Executive Committee to State Finance Secretaries. The Committee resorted to technology-based alternatives for holding virtual discussions due to the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nKey recommendations included:\n1.  Maintaining the interim WMA limit of `51,560 crore up to September 30, 2021, with a subsequent review by the Reserve Bank.\n2.  Retaining the prevailing interest rate on SDF/ WMA/ OD.\n3.  Continuing the OD Regulations, with interim relaxations ceasing by March 31, 2021.\n4.  Continuing the operating limit of SDF calculated against the collateral of investments in G-sec/ ATBs and annual incremental investments in CSF and GRF, with a 5 percent haircut margin."

The condition of permitting States to invest their cash surplus in Auction Treasury Bills (ATBs) only when they have not availed WMA in the immediately preceding period of 90 consecutive days, may also be removed. The Committee urges the remaining States to join CSF/ GRF schemes, build a minimum corpus in CSF and GRF within the next 5 years, and recommends that withdrawal be allowed after a lock-in period of 2 years from constituting the Fund, in place of the prevailing lock-in period of 5 years. The condition in CSF scheme which limits the quantum of withdrawal from CSF to the amount of redemption due for that year towards market borrowing, may be removed. On building the minimum corpus, States may be allowed to withdraw from CSF, any sum in excess of the minimum corpus of 5 per cent. In case of CSF, States will continue to have the existing option of withdrawing from the interest accrued and accumulated in the Fund, and can exercise either one of the withdrawal option, at a single instance. The provision in CSF/ GRF schemes which necessitate consultation with State Governments for selection of securities in case of premature disinvestment from CSF/ GRF, may be removed."

The Committee believes that raising the minimum cash balance does not serve any purpose and runs contrary to the objective, considering WMA limit is being revised upwards periodically in line with cash flows/ budgetary transactions of States. As recommended, the interim WMA limit of `51,560 crore may continue for 6 months i.e., up to September 30, 2021 and revision in the WMA limit thereafter may be decided by the Reserve Bank after assessing the requirement of States. Next Committee-based revision of the WMA Scheme may be carried out after the release of 16th Finance Commission (FC) report so that the fiscal road map proposed by the FC, and the then requirement of States, may be taken into consideration."

    "input": "Question: How has the Ways and Means Advances (WMA) scheme evolved over time, and how does the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) provide financial accommodation to states through this scheme?",
    "output": "The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) provides financial accommodation to states banking with it through an agreement, in the form of Ways and Means Advances (WMA), to help the states manage temporary mismatches in their cash flow of receipts and payments. This financial assistance is intended to aid the states in carrying out their essential activities and normal financial operations.\n\nWMA is governed by Section 17(5) of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Act, 1934. There are two types of WMA: (i) Normal WMA or clean advance, which was introduced in 1937; and (ii) Special WMA instituted in 1953, which is a secured advance provided against the collateral of GoI securities. As requested by State Governments in the SFS conference held in May 2013, the nomenclature of Special WMA was changed to Special Drawing Facility (SDF) since June 23, 2014, by amending the agreement with respective State Governments. In addition to WMA, an Overdraft (OD) facility is also provided whenever financial accommodation to a State exceeds its SDF and WMA limits.\n\nThe maximum amount of such advances by the Reserve Bank and the interest charged thereon are not specified in the RBI Act but are regulated by voluntary agreements with the State Governments and based on the economic environment and recommendations of various Committees.\n\nAs a banker to State Governments, the Reserve Bank is not entitled to any remuneration for conduct of ordinary banking business, other than the advantages which may accrue to it from holding of States\u2019 cash balances, free of obligation to pay interest thereon. State Governments are required to maintain minimum balances as may be agreed upon between the Government and the Bank.\n\nThe WMA Scheme has been periodically reviewed, keeping in view the States\u2019 requirements, the evolving fiscal, financial and institutional developments, and the objectives of monetary and fiscal management. When WMA was introduced in 1937, the limit was kept equal to the minimum balance of the respective State Government. Thereafter, the WMA limit of States was revised periodically and fixed as a multiple of their respective minimum balance. A major change in the principle adopted for working out WMA limits occurred in 1999, following the recommendations made by an Informal Advisory Committee (IAC). Since 1999, the limits are being fixed based on the recommendations of Advisory Committees set up periodically by the Reserve Bank.\n\nAdvances granted to the State Governments by way of SDF, WMA, and OD attract interest on the outstanding amount. Interest rates on such advances are fixed by the Reserve Bank and have witnessed periodic revisions. Currently, the interest rate charged on WMA, SDF, and OD is linked to the Repo Rate."

    "input": "Question: What advisory committees were constituted by the RBI to review the WMA scheme?",
    "output": "The WMA scheme was reviewed in the past by five advisory committees, including an informal Group of State Finance Secretaries (GSFS) set up by the Reserve Bank. Each Committee was headed by a renowned civil servant/ expert with experience in State finances. The advisory committees constituted in 2015 and 2019 were chaired by Shri Sumit Bose and Shri Sudhir Shrivastava respectively. The WMA limits of State Governments/ UT of Puducherry were last revised in January 2016 as recommended by the Advisory Committee set up in 2015 under the chairmanship of Shri Sumit Bose. The Committee had used a formula based on total expenditure of States, which reflected distribution of limit to all States as per their fiscal size. It was felt that the increase in quantum of WMA should be in tandem with the growth in total expenditure. Consequently, the Committee had recommended that WMA limit will be set on the basis of total expenditure adjusted for lottery expenditure. As suggested by the Sumit Bose Committee, and as decided in the 31 st conference of SFS (held on March 18, 2019), a new Committee was constituted in August 2019, with members comprising of Finance Secretaries representing select States, representative from Department of Expenditure, GoI and an academic expert, under the chairmanship of Shri Sudhir Shrivastava, former Additional Chief Secretary, Maharashtra."

    "output": "To provide greater flexibility to State Governments to tide over their cash flow mismatches, the Reserve Bank relaxed the OD regulation of States, effective from April 7, 2020 to Sep 30, 2020, wherein a State/ UT can be in OD continuously for 21 working days as against the existing 14 working days, and can remain in OD for a maximum of 50 working days in a quarter as against the existing 36 working days. These relaxations were eventually extended up to March 31, 2021.\n\nIn the second meeting of the Committee held on July 10, 2020, member States welcomed the interim measures taken by the Reserve Bank, stating that they were able to manage the fiscal stress caused by COVID-19 through additional market borrowings and financial accommodation provided by the Reserve Bank. The Committee suggested that the interim WMA limit of `51,560 crore may continue for a while, with any further revision to be decided by the Reserve Bank after assessing the evolving situation. The Committee also decided to conclude its recommendations after the final report of the 15th FC was released, so that the fiscal roadmap recommended by the FC for States could be taken into consideration while setting the new WMA limits.\n\nDuring the third meeting of the Committee held on February 26, 2021, the draft report was discussed, and the Committee agreed to retain the current interim limit of `51,560 crore for six months in the ensuing financial year (FY 2021-22) i.e., up to September 30, 2021, because the formula-based WMA limit arrived at by the Committee (`47,010 crore) was lower than the interim limit. The Committee proposed that the Reserve Bank may review the WMA limits thereafter, after assessing the course of the pandemic, the macroeconomic situation, and the requirements of States. The Committee also reviewed suggestions from States on items in the ToR, such as SDF/ WMA/ OD and CSF/ GRF schemes. It was decided to emphasize the importance of accurate and timely reporting of data on contingent liabilities, including guarantees issued by States. Revision of the WMA limit was also discussed among States during the 13th Meeting of the Executive Committee (EC) to State Finance Secretaries, held on June 19, 2020."

    "input": "Question: What are the implications of the 15th Finance Commission's recommendations on state finances, particularly regarding transfers to state governments?",
    "output": "The implications of the recommendations by the 15th Finance Commission on state finances are significant. Large transfers to State Governments recommended by Finance Commissions (FC), particularly the 14th FC that increased the share of tax devolution from 32 to 42 per cent of the divisible pool, were essentially meant to address some of the vertical imbalances, while giving greater leeway to States in deciding on the usage of untied transfers. Mirroring this, States\u2019 receipt pattern exhibits an increasing share of revenue receipts coming from Central transfers, while States\u2019 own tax revenues, as a proportion of the States\u2019 GDP, have broadly stagnated, resulting in a reduction in the gap between States\u2019 own revenue and Central transfers that constituted around 7 per cent and 4 per cent of GDP, respectively, during 2000-05. Both have started converging since 2014, initially through higher transfers and more recently through higher grants. Thus, central transfers have played an important role in bridging the resource gap arising on account of growing State expenditure (Reddy, 2018). Committed expenditure of States, however, has been on a rise, accounting for one third of total expenditure."

This is slightly less than the 42 percent mandated by the 14th FC but retains the share recommended in its Interim Report for 2020-21. The marginal reduction is primarily due to the elimination of the share previously allocated to the former state of Jammu and Kashmir (0.8 percent of the divisible pool in 2018-19).  The 15th FC has also altered the criteria for inter se distribution of taxes amongst States, using the 2011 census instead of the 1971 census, introducing a demographic performance criterion, and re-introducing a criterion for tax effort."

Sector-specific grants are performance-based (except for health sector grants) and target three areas: (1) Social sector (health, education), (2) Rural economy (agriculture reforms, rural roads), and (3) Governance (judiciary, statistics, and aspirational districts and blocks). Regarding tax devolution, the 15th FC maintains the share at 41 percent of the divisible pool, adding predictability and stability to resource transfers from the Centre to the States for the years 2021-26, slightly reducing the share mandated by the 14th FC (42 percent), but retaining the share recommended in its Interim Report given for the year 2020-21. The increasing share of grants in the overall pool of transfers, assigned as fixed amounts, enhances the predictability of fund flow, reducing revenue uncertainty."

    "input": "Question: How does the Reserve Bank act as a banker and debt manager to State Governments, and what are the implications of WMA limits on liquidity?",
    "output": "As indicated earlier, the Reserve Bank, by agreement, acts as a banker and debt manager to State Governments and, in its role as a banker, provides temporary advances to State Governments in the form of SDF/ WMA/ OD to help them tide over temporary cash flow mismatches. Once WMA limits are decided, these advances act as a standing facility for States. Consequently, funds availed under the scheme become an autonomous driver of liquidity. In practice, given their temporary nature, WMA to State Governments is not a major driver of systemic liquidity, although it can pose challenges for short-term liquidity forecasting and liquidity management of the Reserve Bank. Moreover, States have different temporal patterns of liquidity gaps and all States typically do not avail the facility simultaneously. On an incremental basis, during 2019-20, increase in the net Reserve Bank credit to State Governments accounted for only 0.4 per cent of accretion to reserve money, as compared to a negative contribution of 0.1 per cent in 2018-19. Reserve Bank credit to State Governments accounted for (-)0.2 per cent of incremental reserve money during 2020-21 (up to March 26, 2021). If, however, all States are simultaneously in WMA, and WMA limits are required to be increased because of an unanticipated protracted shock like Covid-19, it can have significant implications for liquidity management. In view of the above, the WMA limit needs to be revised taking into account the need for discipline in cash management, fiscal prudence and implications for monetary and liquidity management."

    "input": "Question: What factors drive State Governments' revenue receipts and expenditure, and how does the Reserve Bank's WMA scheme address timing mismatches between them?",
    "output": "The factors driving State Governments\u2019 revenue receipts are quite different from those that drive expenditure, and operate largely autonomously of each other. It is, therefore, natural that timing mismatch exist between receipt of revenues and outgo of expenses. Payment of salaries, pensions and repayment/ servicing of GoI loans generally happens during the first week of the month, resulting in substantial withdrawal of cash balances. The Goods and Services Tax (GST) revenue, which is one of the most important source of States\u2019 revenue, usually accrues in the third or fourth week of the month, leading to a build-up of cash balances. The State Governments, hence, either need cash buffers or access to short-term borrowings, or both, while also having avenues to park their temporary surplus. Reserve Bank, as a banker to State Governments, has devised the scheme of WMA precisely for this purpose."

    "output": "According to Williams (2010), good practice in government cash management includes centralizing government cash balances, establishing a Treasury Single Account (TSA), and using modern systems like electronic transactions and advanced banking, payment, and settlement systems. Accurate short-term cash flow projections, information sharing between cash managers, revenue-collecting agencies, and spending ministries, and strong coordination of debt and cash management are also essential. In India, Ways and Means Advances (WMA) serve as a facility to address temporary mismatches between receipts and expenditure, helping States bridge revenue gaps. WMA is viewed within the broader framework of budget, expenditure, debt, and liquidity management, and its effectiveness depends on the States' cash management and fiscal accuracy. If a State remains within its WMA limit and uses it only for temporary mismatches, WMA utilization is considered optimum. Conversely, continuous WMA usage or frequent overdrafts indicate potential issues with budget imbalances and cash flow projections that need attention. WMA management is analogous to inventory management, balancing the cost of holding excess cash against the risk of running out of cash."

    "output": "In the parlance of fiscal policy, fiscal marksmanship refers to the precision or accuracy of a Government\u2019s forecasts or estimates of fiscal indicators in a budgetary exercise. Government budgets typically consist of three sets of numbers \u2013 Budget Estimates (BE) for the next year, Revised Estimates (RE) of the current year lapsed, and Actuals of the previous year. Good fiscal marksmanship entails high forecast accuracy of Government estimates, typically measured through deviation of Actuals from BE and RE. While it is natural for budgetary forecasts to deviate from actual values, the nature of deviation (or errors) needs to be looked through to determine the credibility of budgetary forecasts."

    "output": "Deficits, as derived indicators, have forecast deviations determined by underlying deviations in receipts and expenditure. Revenue deficits show much larger deviation from Budget Estimates (BE) and Revised Estimates (RE) compared to gross fiscal deficit. This is possibly due to the limits imposed on States\u2019 borrowing in Fiscal Responsibility Legislations (FRLs), which forces them to adjust their capital expenditure to meet the fiscal deficit targets."

    "input": "Question: What was the methodology and decision-making process the Committee used to revise the WMA limits for State Governments?",
    "output": "The Committee deliberated on various formulas but decided to continue with the expenditure-based method for arriving at the revised WMA limit for State Governments. To ensure that all States get benefitted, the Committee avoided wide variation in inter-state distribution of WMA limits. The previous Advisory Committee had also adopted the total expenditure of States as the base for calculation of WMA limit, as it was a surrogate for cash flows and facilitated distribution of WMA limit in proportion to the fiscal size of States. Accordingly, this Committee has studied the growth in expenditure of States from 2016-17 to 2018-19 (using only accounts level data) to arrive at the revised WMA limit.\n\nThe Committee decided that the increase in total quantum of WMA limit should not be lower than the CAGR of 9.0 per cent recorded in the total expenditure (Capital and Revenue Expenditure, excluding ad hoc and volatile expenditure like lottery expenditure, natural calamities etc.), during the 3-year period of 2016-17 to 2018-19. Taking into consideration the special developmental needs of Himalayan States (Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Jammu & Kashmir) and North Eastern States (Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Meghalaya, Manipur, Mizoram, Nagaland and Tripura), the quantum of WMA limit is distributed among the States in terms of a formula. The quantum of WMA is bifurcated between HS & NES and other States based on the average base (defined as the average of total expenditure for the past three years using accounts data) arrived at for HS & NES and other States. Thereafter, State-wise WMA limit for HS & NES and other States is obtained by applying the ratio of 2 per cent and 1.75 per cent (after rounding off), respectively, to the average base. However, in order to avoid wide variation in the growth rate of WMA limit, the Committee limited the growth rate of WMA within a range, based on the average growth. Accordingly, the Committee fixed a lower bound of 19.30 per cent and upper bound of 60 per cent growth over the limits set by the previous Advisory Committee (The interim increase in WMA limit on account of COVID-19 pandemic worked out to 60 per cent over the limit recommended by the Sumit Bose Committee). Thus, the total quantum of formula-based WMA limit of States/ UTs stand at `47,010 crore (Annex 8), with an overall increase of 45.9 per cent over the limit of `32,225 crore recommended by the Sumit Bose Committee. The distribution ratio between HS & NES and other States works out to 11:89. A limit of this order is expected to be sufficient to cover the temporary mismatches that could arise from any unexpected shortfall in revenue flows.\n\nRequirement of WMA is not only dependent on the extent of temporary mismatch between revenue and expenditure streams, but also on the initial cash buffer maintained by it. The limits so proposed above take care of a substantial portion of the mismatch that exists. Hence, to ensure that the States do not draw beyond the WMA limits available, it is necessary that they start the monthly receipts-expenditure cycle with a suitable positive cash balance. The Committee reiterates that WMA facility is meant to finance the temporary mismatch in cash flows and should not be seen as a facility to finance durable needs of States."

    "output": "The committee suggests that the interim WMA limit of `51,560 crore may continue for 6 months i.e., up to September 30, 2021 (Table 7) because the effect of the pandemic is still prevalent, and the formula-based revised WMA limit is lower than the interim limit. Depending on the course of the pandemic and its economic and fiscal impact, the Reserve Bank may revise the limit, either based on the formula suggested by the Committee or as may be necessary, after assessing the then requirement of States. The committee recommends continuing the Interim Limit of `51,560 crore till September 30, 2021. Revised State-wise WMA limits arrived by this Committee is set out in Annex-8 of this report."

    "input": "Question: What is the overdraft (OD) facility provided to State Governments, and how has it evolved over time?",
    "output": "When advances to State Governments exceed their SDF and WMA limits, OD facility is being provided. The historical evolution of the OD facility, as summarized by the Sumit Bose Committee, indicates that the limit on the number of days was initially fixed at 7 consecutive working days but was subsequently increased based on representations from a few State Governments. Accordingly, the Reserve Bank introduced some flexibility in the Scheme by enhancing the period for which a State Government could run on OD, from 7 to 10 consecutive working days, with effect from November 1, 1993. As per the recommendations made by IAC in 1998, the Reserve Bank imposed a ceiling on the OD amount at 100 percent of the WMA limit with the provision that OD over 100 percent of the WMA limit had to be cleared within three working days. Subsequently in 2001, based on the recommendations of the informal GSFS constituted by the Reserve Bank, the limit of 10 consecutive working days was extended to 12 consecutive working days and the restriction for bringing down the OD level within the level of 100 percent of the WMA limit was relaxed to five consecutive working days. The Committee observed that even with the enhancement in WMA, resort to OD has not declined and that frequent resort to OD was seen as a manifestation of structural imbalance or bad cash management. The Ramachandran Committee observed that greater resort to OD was a clear indication of fiscal imbalance and unless regulated in time, it would lead to a situation where the corrections would become costly and difficult. However, the total number of days that a State can remain in OD had been extended to 14 consecutive working days by the Ramachandran Committee. The Bezbaruah Committee decided not to modify the existing time limits for OD and continued with the norms that if the OD exceeds beyond 14 consecutive working days, the RBI and its agencies shall stop payments in respect of the concerned State Government; if the WMA limit is exceeded continuously for 5 consecutive working days for the first time in a financial year, the State will be advised by the Reserve Bank to bring down the OD level and if such irregularity persists on a second or subsequent occasion in the financial year, the Reserve Bank will stop payments, notwithstanding the provision of permitting OD up to 14 days. In a quarter, the OD availed should not exceed 36 days irrespective of 14 days & 5 days rules. The Sumit Bose Committee had also retained the above OD regulations."

    "input": "Question: What is the Special Drawing Facility (SDF) provided to State Governments?",
    "output": "The Special Drawing Facility (SDF) is provided to State Governments since April 1, 1953 against the collateral of their investments in marketable securities issued by the Government of India, in addition to Ways and Means Advances (WMA). Initially, a uniform limit of `2 crore was fixed for each State Government. Between March 1967 to Feb 1999, the limits were linked to the minimum balance fixed for each State, and revised periodically. In 1999, the IAC on WMA to State Governments recommended that the limits should be delinked from minimum balances and that States be allowed to draw Special WMA freely against their holdings of GoI securities, subject to margin. In 2005, the Bezbaruah Committee had recommended that the net incremental ( i.e. new investment less redemption/ liquidation) annual investment of States in CSF/ GRF may also be made eligible for availing Special WMA, with the quantum restricted to their Normal WMA limit. The Committee felt that this would encourage the States to continually add to their CSF/GRF balances while they also build a reserve fund for meeting their redemption liabilities. The Sumit Bose Committee, in 2016, had liberalised this facility further, by allowing the States to avail SDF against net incremental annual investments in CSF/ GRF without any upper limit. At present, a uniform hair cut margin of 5 per cent is applied on the market value of the securities for determining the operating limit of SDF on a daily basis.\nHistorically, the rate of interest charged on SDF was initially linked to the Bank Rate and later to the Repo Rate. While SDF against holdings of GoI securities continues to be granted at Repo Rate minus one per cent, the rate of interest on SDF availed against the incremental investments in CSF/ GRF was brought down to Repo Rate minus two per cent, w.e.f. August 10, 2018, in order to encourage the States to build their corpus in CSF/ GRF.\nSince its inception, SDF was being granted against the collateral of investments by State Governments in Central Government dated securities and Auction Treasury Bills, after applying suitable margin. The Ramachandran Committee (2003) had noted that the reserves of Central Government securities built by States can be leveraged to raise collateralised funds from the Reserve Bank and therefore, to encourage the States, the Committee liberalised the scheme with some safeguards. While the margins applied earlier where ranging between ten to fifteen per cent, the Committee recommended application of a uniform haircut margin of five per cent on the market value of securities. The rate of interest was brought down from Bank Rate to Bank Rate minus one per cent and the States were allowed to utilise the Normal WMA only after having fully availed the Special WMA.\nThe Ramachandran Committee had suggested that the securities eligible for SDF should be kept unencumbered and should not include those which are covered under the CSF , the GRF or any other such special schemes, to prevent \u2018double mortgage\u2019 of CSF/ GRF balances. The Bezbaruah Committee decided to permit investments in the CSF and GRF as eligible collateral to avail SDF , in the context of expected improvement in the fiscal environment over the medium term. However, a ceiling equivalent to the Normal WMA limit was prescribed for each State. The Sumit Bose Committee revisited the request of States for liberalising the Scheme further and recommended that the entire incremental investments in CSF and GRF are eligible."

    "input": "Question: What recommendations and observations were made regarding the Special Drawing Facility (SDF) for State Governments?",
    "output": "Following observations and recommendations were made regarding the Special Drawing Facility (SDF) for State Governments: The Sumit Bose Committee suggested that entire incremental investments in CSF and GRF be made eligible for SDF without any limit, in line with dated securities and ATB investments, and to avoid double mortgage issues, the Committee suggested that SDF eligibility be decided on a daily basis. It also observed that permitting States to invest temporary cash surpluses in dated GoI securities and allowing them to avail Special WMA thereafter, was not in accordance with sound financial principles and recommended that States may be permitted to invest their cash surplus in dated GoI securities, provided that they have not availed WMA in the immediate preceding period of 90 consecutive days. Additionally, the Committee observed that since liberalising the operating limit of SDF in 2016, the utilisation of SDF had not increased substantially, but with the onset of COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, utilisation of SDF by States went up significantly, indicating the usefulness of the facility in times of financial stress. Some States requested that SDF should be granted against the entire principal corpus of CSF/ GRF, however the Committee feels that, if States were to be allowed to avail SDF against the collateral of principal corpus, they may not be able to liquidate their investments in CSF/ GRF should the need arise and recommends that the present system of deciding the operating limit of SDF based on the net annual incremental investments in CSF and GRF should continue, without any upper limit. To remove ambiguity, the Committee clarifies that the restrictions on investment in government securities shall not apply to investments of State Governments in CSF and GRF. Finally, the Sumit Bose Committee had suggested that, since ATBs are also government securities, it would be advisable for States to invest in ATBs only when they have not availed SDF for the previous 90 days, similar to the restriction implemented for investments in dated GoI securities."

    "instruction": "Answer the question based on the provided context from the financial report.",
    "input": "Question: What recommendations were made regarding States investing in ATBs and availing SDF, and what considerations were discussed?",
    "output": "The Committee observed that very few States that have been investing continuously in ATBs, have not availed SDF against these investments, except for rare occasions when States have gone into SDF due to unanticipated expenditure. The prevailing condition is unfavorable for States as they have limited options for short-term investment of their surplus balance viz. investment in ATBs & 14-day ITBs. The Committee feels that the restrictions on availing SDF against investment in 91-day T-bills may be removed and States may be allowed to invest in 91-day T-bills without the restriction of 90 days, provided the SDF availed prior to such investment is fully repaid. However, States may adhere to prudent cash management and avoid borrowing from the Reserve Bank while their surplus is invested in ATBs. If such instances prevail, the Reserve Bank may take action as deemed necessary to curtail such arbitrage activities. Currently, if a State avails SDF against investment in 91-day T-bills, in the first occasion, this arbitrage activity will be allowed for a limited period, but the State will not be allowed to invest further in 91-day T-bills for the next 90 days. However, if such practices of availing SDF and subsequent investment in 91-day T-bills continue in the second and subsequent occasions during the financial year, such SDF availed would be treated as WMA after the first occasion."

    "output": "The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) manages two reserve funds on behalf of State Governments for meeting their contingent liabilities: the Consolidated Sinking Fund (CSF) and the Guarantee Redemption Fund (GRF). These funds are built from contributions made by the State Governments. CSF is an amortisation fund created to meet repayment obligations of the Government. The interest accrued and accumulated in the Fund is utilised towards redemption of outstanding liabilities of the Government. GRF is constituted by the State Governments for meeting their obligations arising out of guarantees issued on behalf of State level bodies. Accretions to the Fund can be utilised only towards payment of guarantees issued by the Government (and invoked by the beneficiary) in respect of bonds issued/ other borrowings by their State level undertakings/ other bodies. In 1999, the Reserve Bank had prepared a model CSF Scheme at the request of State Governments and circulated it amongst them for adoption/ consideration. Subsequently, the Twelfth Finance Commission had recommended that the CSF may cover repayments in respect of all the loans of State Governments (and not just open market borrowings). Against this backdrop, the Reserve Bank had circulated a revised model scheme of CSF amongst the State Governments in May 2006. In October 2012, a Working Group (WG) set up to examine various avenues for investment of CSF , to make the Fund viable, had submitted its report. Major recommendations of the WG, inter alia , included building up a minimum corpus of 3-5 per cent of State liabilities within 5 years and maintaining it on a rolling basis thereafter. As on date, 24 States and the UT of Puducherry have set up CSF . The total  corpus built up to March 31, 2020 amounts to `1,30,431.38 crore. Based on recommendations of the \u2018Technical Committee on State Government Guarantees\u2019 (February 1999), many States had taken initiatives to fix a ceiling on guarantees issued by them. Further, a Group of State Finance Secretaries constituted to assess the Fiscal Risk of State Government Guarantees (2002) underlined the importance of according appropriate risk weights in respect of devolution of guarantees and suggested estimation of risk weighted guarantees so as to make adequate budgetary provisions for honouring these guarantees, if they devolve on the States. The Report of the Fiscal Responsibility Legislation (FRL) at the State Level (2005) recommended fixing a limit on annual incremental risk-weighted guarantees in relation to their GSDP/ total revenue receipts. Many States have incorporated this recommendation in their FRL. In 2003, the Reserve Bank had circulated a draft scheme on GRF amongst the State Governments, for voluntary adoption. As on March 31, 2020, 18 State Governments have joined the GRF and have invested a sum of `7,486 crore. The Advisory Committees constituted in 2005 and 2015 had permitted the use of incremental investments in CSF and GRF as collateral for availing SDF , to encourage the State Governments to invest in CSF and GRF liberally. In June 2018, the rate of interest on SDF (availed against investments in CSF and GRF) was lowered from Repo Rate minus one per cent to Repo Rate minus two per cent, to further incentivise and encourage States to build the corpus in CSF and GRF ."

The prevailing interest rate on SDF/ WMA/ OD may be retained.\n3.  The OD Regulations may continue, and the interim relaxations on OD may cease to exist by March 31, 2021. The interim relaxation in OD facility was granted vide Press Release dated April 7, 2020 to increase the number of days a State can continue to be in OD, from 14 to 21 consecutive working days and 36 to 50 working days in a quarter. This relaxation was valid up to March 31, 2021.\n4.  The operating limit of SDF should continue to be calculated against the collateral of investments in G-sec/ ATBs and the net annual incremental investments in CSF and GRF, without any upper limit, and the usual haircut margin of 5 per cent shall be applied.\n5.  The limitation on availing SDF against investment in 91-day T-bills may be removed, and States be allowed to invest in 91-day T-bills without the restriction of 90 days, provided the SDF/ WMA availed prior to such investment is fully repaid. Likewise, the prevailing condition of permitting States to invest their cash surplus in ATBs only when they have not availed WMA in the immediately preceding period of 90 consecutive days, may also be removed. However, States may take care to not avail SDF after investing their cash balances in 91-day T-bills. If such instances prevail, the Reserve Bank may take measures as deemed necessary to curtail such activities.\n6.  The Committee underscores that CSF and GRF are reserve funds, constituted voluntarily by States for a specific purpose, and need to be built up substantially. Hence, the Committee urges the remaining States to join CSF/ GRF schemes, which would facilitate them to withdraw from the Fund to repay liabilities in times of need, and also to avail SDF for managing temporary cash flow mismatches.\n7.  A minimum corpus be built by States in CSF and GRF, within the next 5 years, and maintained on a rolling basis thereafter. States may build a minimum corpus of at least 5 per cent of the total liabilities/ guarantees outstanding at the end of previous FY."

    "output": "The Advisory Committee on Ways and Means Advances to State Governments made the following recommendations regarding the Consolidated Sinking Fund (CSF) and Guarantee Redemption Fund (GRF):\n\n8.  Withdrawal from CSF should be allowed after a lock-in period of 2 years from constituting the Fund, in place of the prevailing lock-in period of 5 years.\n9.  The prevailing condition in CSF scheme which limits the quantum of withdrawal from CSF to the amount of redemption due for that year towards market borrowing, should be removed. States may be allowed to use the total quantum of interest accrued and accumulated in the Fund (up to the end of previous FY) for repayment of outstanding liabilities.\n10. On building the minimum corpus as stated above, States may be allowed to withdraw from CSF , any sum in excess of the minimum corpus of 5 per cent. This will enable States to use the funds invested in excess of the minimum requirement, for repayment of outstanding liabilities. \n11. In case of CSF , States will continue to have the existing option of withdrawing from the interest accrued and accumulated in the Fund, and can exercise either one of the withdrawal option, at a single instance.\n12. The prevailing provision in CSF/ GRF schemes which necessitate consultation with State Governments for selection of securities in case of premature disinvestment from CSF/ GRF , may be removed, in view of operational convenience. Reserve Bank may be allowed to decide on the securities to be liquidated, provided the securities chosen for disinvestment are in profit at the time of sale. \n13. The States may, accordingly, amend their CSF and GRF Schemes and notify the same in their Official Gazette, to avail the benefit of above-mentioned relaxations in the CSF and GRF Schemes.\n14. The Committee recommends that the minimum balance fixed for States may not be revised at present and the system of having differential minimum balance for each State/ UT can continue as it has been working fine so far (Annex 2). The Committee believes that raising the minimum cash balance does not serve any purpose and runs contrary to the objective, considering WMA limit is being revised upwards periodically in line with cash flows/ budgetary transactions of States."

    "input": "Question: What are the details regarding the minimum cash balance that State Governments are required to maintain with the Reserve Bank?",
    "output": "In terms of the agreement between the Reserve Bank and State Governments under Section 21A of the RBI Act 1934, States have to maintain with the Reserve Bank such minimum cash balances as may be agreed upon from time to time, and the Reserve Bank grants WMA to State Governments up to certain limits. The minimum balances were fixed for the first time on April 1, 1937 (effective only from April 1, 1938) based on the ratio of total revenue and expenditure of the concerned provincial Government to the total revenue and expenditure of the pre-provincial autonomy Central Government (based on data of previous 3 years). The minimum balances so fixed also represented the limits up to which States could avail WMA from the Reserve Bank. In the subsequent years, minimum balance for States was reviewed and liberalised as it was found inadequate with respect to the revenue and expenditure of State Governments. The minimum cash balance, as and when revised, formed the basis of revision of WMA limit of States as it was fixed as a multiple of minimum balance. In addition to Normal WMA, SDF has also been in operation since April 1953. A comprehensive review of cash balance and WMA limit was done by Vithal Committee in 1998. Prior to Vithal Committee, WMA limit was equivalent to 168 times the minimum balance of States. The Vithal Committee observed that fixing the WMA limit as a multiple of an unchanged minimum balance, as in the past, does not capture the differing needs of States in line with the growth in their budgetary transactions. Hence, the Committee proposed linking the normal WMA limit to cash flows of the State and suggested total expenditure (i.e., revenue plus capital) less revenue deficit, as the proxy for cash flows. As per the Vithal Committee, the minimum balance worked out to `41.04 crore for all States (`.37.97 crore for the non-special category States and `3.08 crore are for the special category States). Subsequent to joining of UTs of Puducherry and Jammu and Kashmir, the minimum balance went up by `0.15 crore (on December 17, 2007) and `1.14 crore (on April 1, 2011) to `41.19 crore and `42.33 crore, respectively. Minimum balance of States has remained unchanged since Vithal Committee (1999). At present, it stands fixed at `42.33 crore for all States \u2013 bifurcated into `4.38 crore for HS & NES, including Jammu and Kashmir, and `37.95 crore for Other States. Excluding the UT of Jammu and Kashmir, effective minimum cash balance stands at `41.19 crore \u2013 ` 3.24 crore for NE & HS and `37.95 crore for other States. State Governments are required to maintain a minimum balance with the Reserve Bank, which varies from State to State depending on the size of States\u2019 budget and economic activity. Accordingly, the differential minimum balance for States has last been set in 1999 according to their budget size (expenditure and revenue of individual States) relative to total expenditure and revenue, and linked to the same base as for WMA, to reflect the differing needs of States. The differential minimum balance has not been changed since then because the methodology for computing WMA limits had undergone a change and was based on cash flow data of receipts and expenditure as against the earlier methodology wherein WMA limit was derived as a multiple of minimum balance. Moreover, with the funding sources of States\u2019 GFD progressively tilted towards market borrowings, there was no requirement of keeping minimum cash balance as most of the States started having surplus cash which automatically gets invested in ITBs/ ATBs of Central Government."

As liquidity forecasts assumes primacy in the revised framework, adherence to an indicative calendar of WMA for the Centre along with the States would aid liquidity management."

    "input": "Question: What are the implications of the 15th Finance Commission's (FC) recommendations on state finances, particularly regarding tax devolution, grants, and incentive-based mechanisms?",
    "output": "According to the Report of the Advisory Committee on Ways and Means Advances to State Governments, the 15th FC\u2019s recommendations may not significantly alter the resource transfer from the Centre, as maintaining the devolution share at 41 per cent of the divisible pool adds predictability and stability to the transfer of resources. Despite this, a significant decrease in tax devolution since 2019-20, continuing into 2020-21, is driven by the shrinking tax divisible pool due to economic contraction and an increasing share of cesses and surcharges kept outside the divisible pool. The increase in proceeds from cesses and surcharges from 3 per cent of gross tax revenue in 2000-01 to 15 per cent in 2018-19 and further to 23.5 per cent in 2020-21 has reduced the divisible pool, effectively bringing down the devolution share to about 30 per cent of gross tax revenue. The 15th FC has attempted to compensate for this by increasing grants, particularly revenue deficit grants since 2020-21.\n\nThe increasing share of grants in the overall pool of transfers, assigned as a fixed amount rather than a percentage of the divisible pool, adds predictability to the quantum and timing of fund flow, reducing revenue uncertainty. The focus on incentive/performance-based grants is unique and can be seen as a catalyst for change for States. Given states\u2019 preference to borrow less than their borrowing space, incentive-based grants may be preferred over incentive-based additional borrowing. While the Government has indicated that these grants will be subsumed while restructuring centrally sponsored and central sector schemes, new suggestions by FC-XV, such as incentivizing states on producing robust statistics (as in Brazil), can significantly improve effective policymaking. Data transparency on \u2018below the line\u2019 items may help financial markets accurately assess states' financial positions and could be rewarded by the markets, as seen with the Centre's enhanced transparency in the recent Budget."

    "output": "The fiscal roadmap as provided by 15th FC has given some flexibilities. As against the budgeted GFD-GDP ratio of 2.8 per cent for 2020-21, actual could be about 4.5 per cent of GDP, with states\u2019 fiscal succumbing to the scissors\u2019 effects of higher pandemic related expenditure coupled with lower revenues due to growth contraction. The relaxed FC XV fiscal roadmap of GFD-GDP ratio of 4.0 per cent and 3.5 per cent in 2021-22 and 2022-23, respectively, as accepted by the Union Budget, will help ensure that there is no sudden drop in resources. The return to 3.0 per cent target is only from 2023-24 onwards. Another important flexibility given by FC is that it has allowed states to utilise any utilised borrowing space across years within the award period, which the states should try and utilise towards capex push."

Facility of SDF/WMA/OD has become important as there are frequent cash imbalances on account of unpredictability and lower-than-expected resource transfers from the GoI.\n2. The State Government is also facing a major strain on its resource availability due to the impact of the implementation of the 7th Central Pay Commission recommendations for its employees.\n3. Dependence of the State on WMA/OD/SDL is likely to increase, and RBI should consider a liberal dose of WMA facility for the State.\n4. WMA limits may be revised based on 1% of the GSDP of States.\n5. Committee may consider allowing WMA for 120 days at Repo Rate instead of 90 days as prevalent.\n6. Tax revenues are yet to recover while the State\u2019s expenditure continues to see an uptick mostly on account of pandemic related expenditure.\n7. Revision of limits based on total expenditure base seems to be reasonable.\n\nThe Committee proposed that the interim limit of `51,560 crore may continue for six months in the FY 2021-22 i.e., up to September 30, 2021. Thereafter, RBI may review the limit after assessing the evolving economic situation and the requirement of States."

    "output": "Suggestions from States/CAS, Nagpur regarding WMA limits include: the pandemic induced slowdown has severely affected the finances of the States and the revival is expected to be rather slow, hence, while arriving at the new WMA limits of the states, ratio of 3% (instead of 2.03%) may be applied to the average total expenditure of states for the next 5 years or till all the States regain the growth trajectory, or at least the existing ratio of 2.03% may be retained; annual expenditure for 2018-19, 2019-20 & 2021-22 (BE) may be considered instead of 2020-21 (RE) as 2020-21 has been an exceptional year due to COVID-19 pandemic and expenditure of this year may not reflect the actual quantum of SDL required by States to meet their short-term cash crunch; multiplying factor for fixing the WMA limit may be reviewed at higher side. The IDMD's remarks are that the existing methodology has been retained after due deliberations by the Committee, and based on the formula-based methodology adopted by the Committee, the ratio was working out to 1.3% for \u2018other States\u2019, which, however, was enhanced to 1.75% to provide a growth in the WMA limit. Suggestions regarding OD Regulations include: the interim measure may be made permanent as it appears reasonable; however, the provision of stopping of payment may be suspended in case of Natural Calamities/Disasters of rare and severe nature as notified by Disaster Management Authorities and also at times of COVID-19 like pandemic. The IDMD's remark is that interim relaxation provided by RBI for the FY 2020-21, wherein the limit has been extended to 21 working days, will be available till March 31, 2021. Existing limits have been calculated using the total expenditure of States as the base and a ratio of 2.03% has been considered by the previous Advisory Committee for calculating the WMA limits. Payments of the State stopped if a) If a State continues to be in OD beyond 14 consecutive working days; b) If a State continues to be in overdraft for more than 36 working days in a quarter; c) If the OD exceeds 100 per cent of the WMA limit for 5 consecutive working days for the second/ subsequent time in a financial year."

    "output": "For the Financial Year 2020-21, interim relaxations were provided regarding Overdraft (OD) regulations:\n\na) The number of days for which a State/UT can be in OD continuously was increased to 21 working days from the current stipulation of 14 working days.\nb) The number of days for which a State/UT can be in OD in a quarter was increased to 50 working days from the current stipulation of 36 working days.\n\nSuggestions included retaining the interim relaxation beyond March 31, 2021, for the full term of the 15th Finance Commission's recommendations (2021-2026), allowing states to remain in OD continuously for 21 days instead of 14, and permitting states to avail OD in excess of their WMA limit for at least 10 working days instead of 5. Regarding SDF (Special Drawing Facility) limitations on investment in G-sec/ATBs (Government Securities/Treasury Bills), it was suggested that the condition penalizing states for accidental availment of SDF for a few days in the previous 90 days be removed, and that restrictions on investment in CSF (G-sec) and availing SDF thereafter be reviewed to incentivize states to invest in CSF. A proposal was included in the draft report to remove the restriction on SDF."

    "output": "It is not feasible to implement the suggestion because SDF is not a clean advance like WMA, but is granted against collateral i.e., State\u2019s investment in G-sec (CSF & GRF)/ ATBs. Hence, it is linked to investments in CSF/ GRF which act as the collateral. The SDF limit is being calculated on a daily basis; coupon & redemption payments generated out of existing investments in CSF & GRF get REINVESTED into the Fund, and reinvestments are also treated as incremental investments. Hence, even when a State doesn\u2019t make fresh investment in the Fund during a FY, it will continue to have an operating SDF limit. However, fresh investments every year will get a higher SDF limit for States and also will help in building a sizeable corpus."

    "output": "The SDF limit is calculated every day because the value of collateral, i.e., G-sec/ATBs, changes whenever there is investment, disinvestment, or redemption of holdings. It is not feasible to implement the suggestion to calculate SDF limit against the total corpus in CSF/GRF because SDF is a collateralized advance. If a State is allowed to avail SDF against the total corpus in CSF/GRF, until the advance is repaid, the State may not be able to disinvest if the need arises, as the securities will remain mortgaged against SDF. Hence, the SDF limit is calculated only against annual incremental investments in CSF & GRF."

    "output": "Regarding CSF/ GRF Withdrawal policies, the existing provision states that CSF is allowed after 5 years of constituting the Fund, while GRF has no lock-in period. One suggestion is to allow relaxation of the minimum corpus of 5% of the total outstanding liabilities at times of abnormal fiscal crisis like Natural Calamities or pandemics like COVID-19, allowing withdrawal beyond 2.5% of the total outstanding liabilities for any purpose which can be recouped in a period of 3-5 years to the level of 5%. Another suggestion is that withdrawal should be allowed before 5 years, considering the significant redemption pressure on States in the next few years. The RBI has provided interim relaxation due to the prevailing resource position, and relaxation for withdrawal from accumulated balance can be allowed on a case-by-case basis. RBI has provided such interim relaxation in the current FY in response to fiscal stress caused by COVID-19, allowing states to withdraw up to 75% of the balance accumulated in their Fund.\n\nFor the minimum cash balance, the recommendation is to revise the minimum balance is not required. \n\nRegarding other issues, such as negative carry due to surplus cash balance held by State Governments, one suggestion is that the interest rate on 14-day ITBs should be equivalent to the interest rate on WMA chargeable to the Central Government. Another suggestion is that the Ministry of Finance, GoI, and RBI may introduce a scheme allowing State Governments to invest their short-term cash surpluses in short-term CMBs as non-competitive bidders."

In 2014, the \"Charter of Customer Rights\" (CoCR) was released, outlining five basic rights for bank customers. Regulations limiting customer liability in fraudulent electronic transactions were issued in 2017. Regulatory instructions are regularly issued to REs based on financial system conditions, conduct supervision findings, complaint analysis, and recommendations from various committees. The regulatory framework is periodically reviewed and updated to reflect domestic and international financial sector developments. Initiatives also include setting up committees to study customer service quality in banks and suggest improvements.

    "output": "The Committee observed that the Indian regulatory framework and standards on Customer Protection are elaborate and largely aligned with international best practices. The regulations are reviewed and updated periodically by the Reserve Bank to keep them relevant to the evolving financial landscape. The Committee reviewed complaints received under the RE\u2019s Internal Grievance Redress (IGR) mechanism over the past three years and noted that the number of complaints remained around one crore per annum. Regarding the Alternate Grievance Redress (AGR) framework, the Committee noted that the entire Ombudsman framework had been extensively reviewed in 2020-21, leading to the launch of the Reserve Bank - Integrated Ombudsman Scheme (RB-IOS), 2021, based on Simplification, Delegation, Centralisation, and Integration. However, certain gaps in regulation and compliance by REs were identified, and operational solutions were considered to improve customer service. The Committee made recommendations covering regulatory, RE conduct, and technology aspects to strengthen customer service in REs. One major recommendation is that the Reserve Bank may consider moving towards \u201cprinciple-based\u201d regulation for customer service in REs, based on customer-friendly principles like Equitable and Fair Treatment, Transparency and Disclosures, Appropriateness and Suitability, Data Protection / Customer Confidentiality, and Right to Grievance Redress."

    "output": "The Committee made several major recommendations regarding strengthening regulation. The Reserve Bank may consider progressively moving towards \u201cprinciple-based\u201d regulation with regard to customer service in the REs. These may be based on well  -recognised customer - friendly principles, including, but not limited to , Equitable and Fair Treatment, Transparency and Disclosures, Appropriateness and Suitability, Data Protection / Customer Confidentiality, Right to Grievance Redress, etc. The Reserve Bank may put in place a suitable structure of incentives and disincentives to encourage REs to take proactive steps towards enterprise -wide improvements in customer service and impart systemic strength to overall customer protection efforts in the financial sector while imposing a regulatory cost for entities where the quality of customer service is deficient. The Reserve Bank may consider making the Charter of Customer Rights enforceable after reviewing and updating it, and extending the Charter to Non Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) also. The customer service regulation should be consolidated on the principle of same activity same regulation and apply to all the REs depending upon the activity being undertaken by them, irrespective of the category of the REs. With a view to ensure that there is uniformity in classifying, recording and reporting of complaints by the REs, the Reserve Bank should lay down a definition of a complaint under the IGR mechanism which should also capture the complaints which are outside the purview of RB -IOS. An indicative definition could be : \u201cAny reference received formally through electronic or paper mode flagging a \u201cdeficiency in service\u201d, as defined in RB -IOS, pertaining to all the activities which the RE undertakes and services it offers.\u201d The RBI Ombudsmen (RBIOs) should be empowered, based on the facts or a set of similar complaints, to direct the RE concerned to review and undertake suitable corrective action in all such cases and confirm compliance to the Reserve Bank. Being the focal department for Customer Service, Consumer Education and Protection Department (CEPD), may also be empowered to direct all REs to initiate corrective."

    "output": "The recommendations for strengthening regulation are as follows: The Reserve Bank (RBI) may consider progressively moving towards \u201cprinciple-based\u201d regulation with regard to customer service in the REs. The RBI may put in place a suitable structure of incentives and disincentives to encourage REs to take proactive steps towards enterprise-wide improvements in customer service.

The RBI Ombudsmen (RBIOs) should be empowered, based on the facts or a set of similar complaints, to direct the RE concerned to review and undertake suitable corrective action in all such cases and confirm compliance to the Reserve Bank. Consumer Education and Protection Department (CEPD), may also be empowered to direct all REs to initiate corrective action in such cases, if the deficiency in service, in its view, is widely prevalent. The Reserve Bank may develop and publish a \u201cCustomer Service and Protection Index\u201d with a view to capture, at the system level, the quality / standards of customer service and extent of customer protection in the REs through a single score. The Reserve Bank should assess the quality of customer service through periodic and regular thematic studies across the REs to ensure better compliance to the customer service guidelines. The Reserve Bank, during the supervisory process, should take a view on the reasonableness of charges levied by REs for the services offered. In order to address the conflict of interests, and to increase the effectiveness of the Internal Ombudsmen (IO) appointed in the REs, the Reserve Bank may nudge the Indian Banks\u2019 Association (IBA) to create a fund to directly pay the salary / compensation to the IOs of the banks. An RE-agnostic common portal for lodging complaints may be set up by the Reserve Bank so that the customers of any RE can lodge complaints on a single portal."

    "output": "To improve customer service in REs, the Indian Banks\u2019 Association (IBA) may update its Model Operating Procedure (MOP), in line with regulation, for hassle-free settlement of claims in accounts of the deceased account holders, in various scenarios. The MOP may provide for the documents required to be submitted by the claimant. In case nomination exists, the proceeds may be released immediately, upon submission of the required documents. Obtaining nomination in deposit accounts may be made mandatory to facilitate hassle-free settlement of claims in case of death of the account holder, and REs should obtain nominations in all existing accounts without nominations within a reasonable time period, such as three years. To obviate the need for visits to the branches / RE premises, by the nominee / heirs, the process for settling deceased claims may also be made available on-line. The on-line facility may provide for submission of all the required documents and their verification. A system of generating digital reference number upon submission of the claim and supportive documents may be made available. The claims may be settled within a reasonable time period, say 30 days from the date of submission of all necessary documents. The timeframe should also apply when the claims are submitted offline."

    "output": "In case of loss of property documents, the RE should not only be obligated to assist in obtaining certified registered copies of documents at their cost but also compensate the customer adequately, keeping in view the time taken to arrange the alternate copies of the documents. REs may provide an option for the relatives of the senior citizens to pay upfront for the door-step services as well as other such conveniences, if any, to be availed by their elders. The pensioners should be able to submit Life Certificate (LC) at any branch of the bank in which they maintain their pension account. Moreover, they should be allowed to submit LC in any month of their choice to avoid rush in a particular month, with subsequent LCs submitted in the same month at annual intervals. Compensating the customer in case of any injury suffered while availing services at the premises of the RE, due to inadequate / faulty infrastructure, and bearing the medical expenses, if any, should be a part of customer policy of the RE. The REs should take adequate insurance cover for such eventualities, and the customer and staff should be made aware of the same. Cross selling of third - party products by the sales team of the RE should be subject to verification by the audit function to ensure that there was no mis-selling and all instructions / guidelines with respect to sale of such products were adhered to. Till the recommendation for a common complaint portal (as mentioned in para 3.3.8.1) is put in place, the REs should have a system to enable the complainant to track the progress in processing of the complaint, outlining the expected time for resolution."

They can also leverage Conversational Artificial Intelligence (AI) by integrating and personalizing ChatBots into mobile apps or websites to answer frequently asked questions and get answers anytime, anywhere. Furthermore, REs should look at designing a frictionless journey using Straight Through Processing (STP) and expand digitisation of branches with paperless journeys and self-help kiosks, enabling customers to carry out faster transactions. They can also utilize Video based Customer Identification Process (V  - CIP), an alternate method of customer identification with facial recognition and customer due diligence."

In the case of merchants, the sale/dispatch of merchandise should be kept on hold. These actions may be implemented as Straight Through Processing (STP) to the extent possible, as described in [5.3.4.1]. Additionally, the Call Centre of REs may be designed with a dedicated IVRS flow, sharing the important \u2018do\u2019s and don\u2019ts\u2019 with the customer, based on the customer profile/queries, including the provision of in-house financial advisors for complex queries or sophisticated customers.

    "output": "The Reserve Bank introduced the Banking Ombudsman Scheme (BOS) in the banking sector in 1995. Over the years, the scheme was amended and expanded to include Regional Rural Banks (RRBs) and scheduled Primary (Urban) Co -operative Banks (UCBs). Subsequently, separate Ombudsman Schemes were launched for Non Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) in 2018 and Non-bank Payment System Participants in 2019. In 2021, the above three schemes were integrated into a new scheme - the Reserve Bank Integrated Ombudsman Scheme (RB - IOS), 2021. The Scheme was also extended to Non -scheduled UCBs with deposit base of \u20b950 crore and above and later to Credit Information Companies (CICs). The RB - IOS is jurisdiction neutral, adopts \u201cone nation one ombudsman\u201d approach and is complemented by a Centralised Receipt and Processing Centre (CRPC) set up for receipt of non-portal complaints and their initial processing. The CRPC also hosts a Contact Centre with 24x7x365 Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS) . Customer Care executives are available for any clarifications / information etc. between 8:00 AM to 10:00 PM in Hindi and English and between 9:30 AM to 5:30 PM in 10 regional languages. Complaints from customers of REs not covered under RB -IOS are attended to by the Consumer Education and Protection Cells (CEPCs) of Reserve Bank.\n\nThe CMS was setup in 2019 as a 24x7 on -line, end -to-end automated, one -stop solution for lodging and redress of customer complaints including receipt, processing and communication of resolution.

As of now, CEPD oversees the operations of 23 RBI Ombudsman offices spread across the country and the Consumer Education and Protection Cells (CEPCs) in 30 Regional Offices / Sub-offices of the Bank set up in 2015-16 to deal with complaints falling outside the ambit of BOS. In 2019, CEPD also became the focal department dealing with regulation relating to customer protection.\n\nCharter of Customer Rights (CoCR): The CoCR was issued by the Reserve Bank on December 03, 2014 as an overarching principle-based guidance for banks on \u2018five\u2019 basic rights of bank customers enunciated therein, viz., (i) Right to Fair Treatment; (ii) Right to Transparency, Fair and Honest Dealing; (iii) Right to Suitability; (iv) Right to Privacy; and, (v) Right to Grievance Redress and Compensation.\n\nLimiting the liability of customers in fraudulent electronic transactions: The Reserve Bank issued specific regulation in July 2017 for limiting the customer liability in unauthorized electronic transactions resulting in debits to their accounts. The liability has been set according to the type of account held and the time taken by the customer to report the transaction to the RE.\n\nHarmonisation of Turn Around Time (TAT) for failed digital transactions: Observing that a large number of complaints emanate on account of unsuccessful transactions, Reserve Bank introduced in September 2019, a framework for bringing uniformity in processing of the failed digital transactions put through authorized payment systems."

By September 2018, this mechanism was extended to all Scheduled Commercial Banks (excluding RRBs) with over 10 banking units in India, and later to deposit-taking Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs-D) with more than 10 branches, non-deposit taking NBFCs (NBFC-NDs) with a retail customer interface and asset size of \u20b95,000 crore or more, Non-bank Payment System Participants (PSPs) with over one crore Prepaid Payment Instruments (PPIs) outstanding, and all Credit Information Companies (CICs). Additionally, to enhance the Internal Grievance Redress (IGR) Mechanism in banks, the Reserve Bank implemented a comprehensive framework in January 2021, built on four pillars: enhanced disclosures by banks on customer complaints; recovery of redress costs from banks with complaint numbers exceeding their peer group average in the Offices of RBI Ombudsmen (ORBIOs); intensive review of the grievance redress mechanism; and regulatory measures."

Further, it emphasizes the need for coordination between prudential, regulatory, and supervisory functions for customer protection and ensuring that these functions and supervision are risk-based to optimize the use of resources. All written communication (including in electronic formats) should be easy to read, and any unfair terms and conditions, if used, should be void and legally unenforceable. Collection and use of data by Regulated Entities (REs) should be in compliance with jurisdiction-specific laws. Compliance with minimum standards should be ensured within the complaints handling function, and analysis of complaints information should be encouraged to continuously improve policies, procedures, and products. For an efficient deposit insurance system, the regulator or supervisor should be able to take necessary measures to protect depositors when a deposit-taking financial service provider is unable to meet its obligations."

    "output": "Chapter 3 aims to strengthen customer service regulation, emphasizing that financial consumer protection should be an integral part of the legal, regulatory, and supervisory framework, comprehensively covering all types of financial products and services. The regulatory framework of the Reserve Bank sets minimum benchmarks in both prudential and operational segments for Regulated Entities (REs). In customer service, the standards require regulation to reflect the characteristics, type, and variety of financial products and services, the diversity of customers, their rights and responsibilities, and new products, services, designs, technologies, and delivery channels. The framework is updated to remain relevant to the changing financial sector landscape. Despite existing instructions to improve customer service, non-compliance and numerous complaints suggest these instructions are followed more in letter than in spirit, with REs often implementing only the minimum guidelines. The Committee suggests a move towards principle-based regulation in the medium-term."

    "output": "The Committee recommends that the Reserve Bank may consider progressively moving towards \u201cprinciple-based\u201d regulation with regard to customer service in the REs. These may be based on well-recognised customer-friendly principles, including, but not limited to, Equitable and Fair Treatment, Transparency and Disclosures, Appropriateness and Suitability, Data Protection / Customer Confidentiality, Right to Grievance Redress, etc. The Committee also noted that while an elaborate regulatory framework on customer service is in place, no enforcement action against REs for deficiency in customer service is taken. The current disincentive mechanism through the framework for \u201cStrengthening Internal Grievance Redress Mechanism in banks\u201d is not functioning effectively and the number of complaints received under RB-IOS is consistently rising. The REs are also merely redressing individual complaints. The system also does not provide any regulatory incentive to the REs for bringing about improvements at the enterprise level for better customer service. Accordingly, the Committee recommends that the Reserve Bank may put in place a suitable structure of incentives and disincentives to encourage REs to take pro-active steps towards enterprise-wide improvements in customer service and impart systemic strength to overall customer protection efforts in the financial sector while imposing a regulatory cost for entities where the quality of customer service is deficient."

    "output": "Under RB-IOS, an overwhelming percentage of rejected (fully / partly) complaints are not being referred by the REs to the IO before conveying the decision to the customers. From November 12, 2021, till March 31, 2023, only 24.73% of complaints processed by RBIOs had been vetted by the IOs; in the case of appeals, the percentage stood at 11.11%. Although the IO schemes provide for the independence of IOs, certainty of tenure, and non-reappointment in the same entity, the IOs often uphold the decisions taken by the REs, which are then overturned by the RBIO or the AA. To address the conflict of interest and increase the effectiveness of the Internal Ombudsmen (IO) appointed in the REs, the Reserve Bank may nudge the Indian Banks\u2019 Association (IBA) to create a fund to directly pay the salary/compensation to the IOs of the banks. Similar funds can be created by respective Self-Regulatory Organizations (SROs) for other categories of REs, or the Reserve Bank itself may consider creating the fund. The cost of the fund may be recovered from the REs in proportion to the complaints against them referred to the IOs."

Furthermore, the Reserve Bank may integrate this platform with its Complaint Management System (CMS) portal for seamless transfer and movement of complaints and data. This common complaint platform should also consolidate data on all types of complaints, redress provided/rejected (under both Internal Grievance Redressal (IGR) and Automated Grievance Redressal (AGR)), and utilize advanced data analytics like AI/ML for complaint segregation, decision support, and improvements in customer service and grievance redress systems at both the RE and system levels."

This recommendation stems from the fact that a number of Prepaid Payment Instruments (PPI) issuers have been authorised by the Reserve Bank in recent times, and the money kept in wallets are in the nature of deposits. However, currently the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) cover extends only to the bank deposits. Extending deposit insurance to the PPI segment needs examination because PPI issuers are also regulated by the Reserve Bank. To start with, the cover can be extended to bank PPIs and later, based on experience gained, to non-bank PPIs."

Obtaining nomination in deposit accounts may be made mandatory to facilitate hassle-free settlement of claims in case of death of the account holder, and the REs should be asked to obtain nominations in all such cases within a reasonable time period, say three years. To obviate the need for visits to the branches / RE premises, by the nominee / heirs, the process for settling deceased claims may also be made available on -line, providing for submission and verification of all required documents, a system of generating digital reference number upon submission, and settlement within a reasonable time period (e.g., 30 days), with interest payable beyond that timeframe. Finally, the Committee recommends that banks should not stop operations in the account when required KYC documents are not submitted in time, as freezing accounts for non-submission of KYC, even though the regulation does not provide for it , and dishonouring cheques issued by the account holder was reported to be a practice in many REs."

While the REs (Regulated Entities) should take necessary steps to periodically update KYC (Know Your Customer), it must be ensured that operations in the account are not stopped.\n2.  The RE should maintain a centralised database of KYC documents of all customers, linked to a unique customer identifier, say the Customer Information File (CIF), obviating the need for submitting KYC documents repeatedly for availing multiple facilities from the same RE. Whenever KYC documents are updated by the customer, the same should be reflected for all other facilities availed by the customer from the RE.\n3.  REs are required to categorize customers as low, medium and high-risk, based on the assessment and risk perception of the RE, on parameters such as customer\u2019s identity, social / financial status, nature of business activity and information about the customer\u2019s business and their location, etc., and adopt a risk-based approach with respect to periodic updation of KYC. The Committee observed that some REs classify customers with \u201chigh net worth\u201d or all \u201cwalk -in customers\u201d as high risk and follow uniform processes for monitoring of all customers within that risk profile, putting diverse individual customers to the same rigour, as, say customers with complex business ownership structures, even if the customer may have been a highly paid executive with uniform pattern of inflows and outflows consistent with her profile.

    "output": "The REs may adopt a nuanced approach for risk categorisation of the customers. For example, salary earners with inflows and outflows consistent with the customer\u2019s profile need not necessarily be categorised as high risk, even though they may be \u201chigh net worth\u201d individuals. Similarly, students can also be categorized as low-risk.

To improve ease of service, the Committee recommends the following:\n\n1.  The REs should provide a dedicated telephone number where senior citizens can call for clarifications, queries, and guidance regarding eligible services. This number should be prominently displayed at all branches and on the RE's website, as well as printed on passbooks and account statements issued to senior citizens and disabled persons.\n2.  REs may provide an option for relatives of senior citizens to pay upfront for door-step services and other conveniences availed by their elders.

    "output": "The Committee recognizes that for prompt redress of grievances, the branch and front-end teams need to be fully conversant with policies, rules and guidelines as well as the operational processes and procedures. Therefore, the Committee recommends that: the REs must ensure that the frontline / customer interfacing staff should be fully conversant with the policies, rules and guidelines, etc. and should also have the decision making power to improve the Turn Around Time ( TAT) for disposal of complaints. Till the recommendation for a common complaint portal (para 3.3.8.1) is put in place, the REs should have a system to enable the complainant to track the progress in processing of the complaint. The expected time for resolution of the complaint should invariably be communicated to the complainant. If the TAT for resolution is exceeded, the same should be communicated to the complainant, indicating reasons for the delay. The most important element for effective grievance redress is sensitivity of customer - facing staff members towards the customer. In this context, the Committee recommends that customer - facing staff and officers should undergo mandatory training in soft skills to reduce instances of misbehavior by the errant staff / officers. Adequate knowledge and in -depth understanding of the internal guidelines and the regulatory instructions must be an essential requirement for posting employees in Internal Grievance Redress (IGR) related positions."

    "output": "The benefits of digitalisation for customers of the financial sector are significant: FinTech innovations provide them with wider choice at lower costs, faster speed, convenience, personalisation and security. It enables democratisation of the financial sector through greater access to financial products and services thereby supporting financial inclusion. Digitalisation also acts as a spur for competition by expanding the range of providers by the way of new entrants, contributing to increasing efficiency of operations of financial service providers and facilitating comparison shopping and switching of products. However, this also brings new challenges for the financial sector entities and regulators. The Committee felt that technology must be adequately leveraged by Regulated Entities (REs) to improve customer service. Most of the technological improvements by REs are on the business side and not from the customer service perspective. Technology being a driving force in REs when compared to the past decade, its role is required to be examined and considered in-depth, for enhancing customer protection. The REs are not making use of the lager data available with them to provide better customer service. It was also observed that REs were not able to provide simple"

    "output": "Regulated Entities (REs) need to continuously evaluate and adopt new and suitable tech solutions such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Robotic Process Automation for improving customer experience while also protecting customer interests. The human power required to run repetitive, task-based processes is expensive, so automation of processes at the backend and enabling AI capabilities for actions allow for increased productivity and value. Enabling bots and AI tech by Risk and Compliance departments to test full sets of data, not just samples, make their monitoring and control activities more efficient. Operational departments in REs can leverage Optical Character Recognition, Bots, routing logic to speed up case completion times and reduce re-work. AI frees up human resources to focus on customer service and grievance redress which require human interaction and judgment. According to section 5.1.2, the Committee felt that technology must be adequately leveraged by Regulated Entities (REs) to improve customer service."

These profiles can then be stored within a central repository in the CRM, so that employees can easily access them to make more informed decisions including developing targeted customer awareness campaigns, upselling, and offering ancillary products. With Conversational AI, REs may provide customers a personalized experience, such as integrating a ChatBot into a mobile app or website to answer frequently asked questions anytime, anywhere. The facility may be developed to restrict human involvement to handle only advanced or complex queries. ChatBots in multiple languages may be provided for supporting a vernacular customer base. Given growing digitization and technological advances, REs should aim to be digital-first in their operations, offering assisted/unassisted options for customers to undertake transactions. In a multilingual country like India, REs should offer services in multiple and local languages, with appropriate interfaces provided in the language the customer is conversant with. For customers comfortable with digital transactions, REs may design a frictionless journey using Straight Through Processing (STP), expanding digitisation of branches with paperless journeys and self-help kiosks to enable faster transactions."

    "output": "The rise in the share of complaints pertaining to digital transactions reflects new risks associated with digitalization of the financial sector services, which need to be monitored, measured, and mitigated. To elaborate, such risks include new forms of thefts or frauds perpetrated on-line, data breaches and digital security incidents, excessive data profiling leading to financial exclusion, lack of privacy and manipulation of customer behavioral biases when operating on-line, etc. Moreover, the nature of digital security risk is extremely dynamic, with the continuous appearance of new threats and identification of new vulnerabilities. The number, frequency and impact of cyber incidents / attacks have increased manifold in the recent past, more so in the case of financial sector including banks, underlining the urgent need to put in place a robust cyber security / resilience framework at banks and to ensure adequate cyber-security preparedness on a continuous basis. In this increasingly risky environment, the need for effective financial customer protection, including data protection, is more important than ever. The Committee recommends measures to ensure safety of digital transactions and privacy of digital customers, including improved analytics capabilities to mine user data for insights and the deployment of safer means of second-factor authentication by the REs as a countermeasure to fraudulent digital transactions perpetrated by obtaining OTPs from victims."

    "output": "Biometric sensors on smartphones like face, fingerprint, or iris scanners can replace physical signatures, making physical presence unnecessary and helping senior citizens access banking services more easily. These scanners can also augment OTP-based authentication as an additional security layer, reducing fraud. Further recommendations include advising REs to provide alerts to customers during 'teachable moments,' such as warnings against sharing credentials, and implementing automatic blacking out of mobile application screens when screen sharing is detected to curb screen sharing malware. The Committee observed that funds withdrawn by fraudsters are moved across multiple banks and / or different accounts. In order to prevent the flow of funds, it is recommended that an on-line facility be made available on the Indian Cybercrime Reporting Portal for registering complaints by members of public in respect of fraudulent transactions. The complaint should trigger an automated alert mail from the victim\u2019s bank to beneficiary bank / card issuer / merchants for blocking the flow of funds. The beneficiary bank should immediately block equivalent amount in the account till detailed verification of the reported transaction in the complaint is completed. In case of merchants, sale / dispatch of merchandise should be kept on hold. All these may be implemented as STP, to the extent possible."

Technology may be leveraged to facilitate the effective design of grievance redress mechanisms, which should not impose unreasonable cost, delays or burdens on customers. The needs of customers, including those experiencing vulnerability, should be considered when designing and publicising complaints handling and redress mechanisms (5.4.1). REs may utilize Artificial Intelligence ( AI) / Machine Learning ( ML) algorithms etc., to provide auto / instant resolution for complaints involving financial disputes of low amounts (5.4.2). Financial awareness in respect of new digital products and technologies should be promoted by all REs as a part of wider financial inclusion as well as financial literacy strategy. Appropriate mechanisms should be developed to help customers gain the knowledge, skills, behaviours and attitudes to be aware, understand risks and opportunities, make informed choices, know where to go for assistance, and take effective action to support their financial well-being and resilience. Such mechanisms may also involve enhancing digital financial literacy skills, raising awareness of digital security risks and promoting safe on -line and digital transactions (5.5.1)."

    "output": "The Committee recognizes the overload of information flowing to the common person, most of which is in digital modes. However, digital channels also provide the most efficient and quickest modes of reaching the customer. Accordingly, it is useful if the willing customers are identified for sharing more detailed communications on specific products and services, and customers may be offered an option of subscription to the alerts for a set domain of banking services. The Committee also suggests that the Call Centre of REs may be designed with a dedicated Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS) flow, sharing the important \u2018do\u2019s and don\u2019ts\u2019 to the customer, based on the customer profile / queries including provision of in-house financial advisors for complex queries or sophisticated customers. An automated call back feature in Call Centre, when a call is dropped mid-way, needs to be provided.

These may be based on well-recognised customer-friendly principles, including, but not limited to, Equitable and Fair Treatment, Transparency and Disclosures, Appropriateness and Suitability, Data Protection  / Customer Confidentiality, Right to Grievance Redress , etc. The Reserve Bank may put in place a suitable structure of incentives and disincentives to encourage REs to take pro-active steps towards enterprise-wide improvements in customer service and impart systemic strength to overall customer protection efforts in the financial sector while imposing a regulatory cost for entities where the quality of customer service is deficient. The Reserve Bank may consider making the Charter of Customer Rights enforceable after reviewing and updating it, and consider extending the Charter to Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) also.

    "output": "To ensure uniformity in classifying, recording, and reporting of complaints by the REs, the Reserve Bank should lay down a definition of a complaint under the IGR mechanism which should also capture the complaints which are outside the purview of RB-IOS. An indicative definition could be: \u201cAny reference received formally through electronic or paper mode flagging a \u201cdeficiency in service\u201d, as defined in RB - IOS, pertaining to all the activities which the RE undertakes and services it offers.\u201d Persisting wrong classification / misclassification of complaints by REs may be taken as one of the parameters in the framework for \u201cStrengthening of Grievance Redress Mechanism in banks\u201d put in place by the Reserve Bank and in the rating of the REs. The RBI Ombudsmen (RBIOs) should be empowered, based on the facts of a complaint or a set of similar complaints, to direct the RE concerned to review and undertake suitable corrective action in all such cases and confirm compliance to the Reserve Bank. The Consumer Education and Protection Department (CEPD) may also be empowered to direct all REs to initiate corrective action in such cases, if the deficiency in service, in its view, is widely prevalent. The Reserve Bank may develop and publish a \u201cCustomer Service and Protection Index\u201d with a view to capture, at the system level, the quality / standards of customer service and extent of customer protection in the REs through a single score.

The findings should feed suitably into the framework to improve IGR and the proposed ratings of REs.  [3.3.5.1]\n3.  6 The Reserve Bank, during its supervisory process, should take a view on the reasonableness of charges levied by REs for the services offered. [3.3.6.1]\n4.  7 In order to address the conflict of interest, and to increase the effectiveness of the Internal Ombudsmen (IO) appointed in the REs, the Reserve Bank may nudge the Indian Banks\u2019 Association (IBA) to create a fund to directly pay the salary / compensation to the IOs of the banks.  Similar funds can be created by respective Self-Regulatory Organisations (SROs) for other categories of REs. Alternatively, the Reserve Bank itself may consider creating the fund. Cost of the above fund, thus created, may be recovered from the REs, in proportion to the complaints against them referred to the IOs. [3.3.7.1]\n5.  8 An RE-agnostic common portal for lodging complaints may be set up by the Reserve Bank so that the customer s of any RE can lodge complaints on a single platform.  The portal may allocate the complaints to respective REs, enable facility for tracking of the complaint by the complainant and for automatic escalation of rejected complaints to the IOs. Going forward, the Reserve Bank may also consider integrating this platform with its CMS portal to provide for seamless transfer and movement of complaints and data.  [3.3.8.1]"

    "output": "To facilitate hassle-free settlement of claims in case of death of the account holder, obtaining nomination in deposit accounts may be made mandatory. Regulated Entities (REs) should obtain nominations in all existing accounts without nominations within a reasonable time period, such as three years. To obviate the need for physical visits, the process for settling deceased claims may also be made available online, allowing for submission and verification of required documents. A system of generating a digital reference number upon submission of the claim and supportive documents should be implemented. Claims should be settled within a reasonable time period, such as 30 days from the date of submission of all necessary documents, whether submitted physically or online. Beyond 30 days, REs may be required to pay interest at a rate, such as two percent higher than the rate at which the deceased person\u2019s deposit was held. While REs should periodically update KYC, they must ensure that operations in the account are not stopped. The RE should maintain a centralised database of KYC documents of all customers, linked to a unique customer identifier like the Customer Information File (CIF), obviating the need for submitting KYC documents repeatedly for availing multiple facilities from the same RE. Whenever KYC documents are updated by the customer, the same should be reflected for all other facilities availed by the customer from the RE."

For example, salary earners with inflows and outflows consistent with the customer\u2019s profile need not necessarily be categorized as high risk, even though they may be \u201chigh net worth\u201d individuals. Similarly, students can also be categorized as low - risk. Repeat presentation of debit mandates / cheques may be done by REs only after obtaining a confirmation from the customer. REs should mandatorily send monthly statement of account/s to the registered email ID of the customer. They may continue to provide physical copies when desired by the account holder.

In case of loss of property documents, the RE should not only be obligated to assist in obtaining certified registered copies of the documents at their cost but also compensate the customer adequately, keeping in view the time taken to arrange the alternate copies of the documents. Keeping the security documents by the REs in digi-lockers may be encouraged as this will facilitate easy retrieval in case the physical documents are misplaced. In the case of gold loan companies, in case of death of the borrower, a notice may be served to the nominee / legal heir to settle the outstanding and keep the same on record before auctioning the pledged gold. Accountability may be fixed for non-adherence to the due notification process prior to auction of gold, and for facilitating this, the GLCs may be required to register nominees while extending loans. Circumstances leading to auction of gold and requirement of a notice period should mandatorily be a part of GLC\u2019s Fair Practices Code as well as the Loan Agreement. As large volumes of gold loan accounts belong to middle and low income households and rural population, Terms and Conditions should be communicated to them in local / regional languages.

    "input": "Question: What are the key developments and overview of the interest rate derivatives (IRD) market in India, as assessed by the Committee on MIBOR Benchmark?",
    "output": "According to the Report of the Committee on MIBOR Benchmark, the interest rate derivatives (IRD) market in India has shown remarkable development over the last decade, with total outstanding IRD contracts increasing from \u20b918 lakh crore in 2014 to \u20b9100 lakh crore in 2024. The market is characterized by a high degree of electronic trading and central clearing, ensuring price transparency and facilitating efficient execution of large trades. Non-resident participation in the onshore market from 2019 has further deepened the IRD market.\n\nThere has been a structural change in funding markets, with collateralised money markets gaining importance, leading to the prominence of interest rate benchmarks like SOFR in the United States and SARON in Switzerland. Other developments include banks pricing loans on external benchmarks, increasing hedging requirements for interest rate risks.\n\nA committee was set up to review interest rate benchmarks in India, focusing on MIBOR, and to study international experiences. The committee provided recommendations to further develop the IRD market and improve the credibility of interest rate benchmark rates.\n\nThe report details the composition and Terms of Reference (ToR) of the Committee. Efforts to develop the market began in 1999 with the introduction of over-the-counter (OTC) rupee derivatives. Regulatory initiatives have facilitated market liquidity, transparency, and participation. Recent years have seen efforts to improve market infrastructure, facilitate product innovation, widen participant base and encourage participation. \n\nCurrently, MIBOR-based overnight indexed swaps (OIS) contract is the predominant instrument, accounting for almost 86 per cent of the \u20b9100 lakh crore of outstanding IRD contracts. Market-making in IRDs is concentrated among foreign banks, private sector banks and standalone primary dealers, with public sector banks playing a relatively small role. The onshore and offshore rupee IRD markets have become more integrated."

    "input": "Question: What are the key points discussed in chapters four through seven of the Committee on MIBOR Benchmark report?",
    "output": "Chapter four of the Report of the Committee on MIBOR Benchmark assesses the global landscape of IRDs, noting IRSs constitute 83 per cent of the US$ 574 trillion outstanding global OTC IRD transactions according to BIS data in March 2023. Different jurisdictions favor IRS instruments tied to specific benchmarks, concentrating liquidity in one main IRS product, while market-makers manage risk from multiple benchmarks through basis swaps.\n\nChapter five discusses the domestic market's dependence on MIBOR-based OIS, highlighting that a single IRS instrument may not fully capture varied interest rate risks. Hedging interest rate risk from one benchmark using a derivative based on another creates basis risks. The committee also noted risks associated with concentration of activity around a single benchmark under circumstances where it may become less reliable, inaccurate, or unrepresentative of the underlying market.\n\nChapter six discusses recent money market developments and their implications on MIBOR. The committee reflected on the structural shift towards secured overnight markets and away from uncollateralised inter-bank markets, observing that MIBOR is based on a progressively lower number and volume of transactions. \n\nChapter seven examines transitioning from MIBOR to a potentially more robust alternate benchmark for IRDs. The committee noted that current overnight benchmarks do not incorporate transactions from the TREP segment, which constitutes around 70 per cent of total money market transactions. It assessed the rates derived from the TREPS / basket repo market vis-\u00e0-vis the call money market. The Committee also deliberated on the need to develop a range of IRD products along with improvements in associated market infrastructure, with an overall objective of further market development."

    "output": "The Committee's recommendations, as detailed in chapter eight of the report, are divided into those related to MIBOR and MIBOR OIS, and those related to IRDs.\n\nRecommendations related to MIBOR and MIBOR-based OIS:\n(a) Financial Benchmarks India Limited (FBIL) may change the methodology for computation of MIBOR to include call transactions based on the first three hours instead of the first hour.\n(b) FBIL may develop and publish a benchmark based on the secured money market \u2013 Secured Overnight Rupee Rate (SORR), computed from trades in first three hours of the basket repo and the TREP segments.\n(c) Fixed Income Money Market and Derivatives Association of India (FIMMDA) may draw up the operational guidelines and market conventions for transactions in IRD based on SORR. Clearing Corporation of India Ltd (CCIL) may develop the requisite trading and clearing infrastructure for the instrument.\n(d) Transition to proposed SORR based IRD, from MIBOR OIS, may be considered only when reasonable liquidity develops in the new IRD. In the interim, market participants may continue using IRDs based on both the benchmarks.\n\nRecommendations related to IRDs:\n(a) The access of non-residents to the onshore IRD markets, beyond MIBOR OIS, for purposes other than hedging may be permitted in a gradual manner based on an assessment of the evolving market conditions and subject to appropriate risk-controls.\n(b) The sectoral regulations for various financial sector participants (NBFCs, mutual funds, insurance companies, etc.) may be reviewed with a view to providing flexibility to these institutions to manage their interest rate risks with flexibility and efficiency.\n(c) Banks may review the possibility of pricing of small ticket advances based on market-determined benchmarks, including term benchmarks.\n(d) FIMMDA may set up a Working Group of market participants to deliberate on the various aspects of developing a market for basis swaps and also finalise market conventions in this regard.\n(e) FBIL may expand the bouquet of term benchmarks in consultation with market participants. FIMMDA may develop market conventions for such products in consultation with market participants.\n(f) CCIL may examine offering electronic trading, central clearing, and dissemination of anonymized trade information for a larger bouquet of IRD products."

    "output": "According to the Report of the Committee on MIBOR Benchmark, it was announced in the Statement of Development and Regulatory Policies dated August 5, 2022, that the Mumbai Interbank Outright Rate (MIBOR) based overnight indexed swap (OIS) contracts are the most widely used interest rate derivatives (IRDs) in the onshore market. The usage of MIBOR based derivative contracts has increased with steps taken by the Reserve Bank to diversify the participant base and facilitate the introduction of new IRD instruments. At the same time, the MIBOR benchmark rate, calculated based on call money deals executed on the NDS-call platform in the first hour after market opening, is based on a narrow window of transactions. Internationally, there has been a shift to alternate benchmark rates with wider participant bases (beyond banks) and higher liquidity. Amidst these developments, it was proposed to set up a committee to undertake an in-depth examination of the issues, including the need for transition to an alternate benchmark, and suggest the most appropriate way forward.\n\nAccordingly, a Committee on the MIBOR benchmark was constituted with the following terms of reference:\n\u2022\t Review of existing Rupee interest rate benchmarks in the country. \n\u2022\t A study of international experiences in developing / use of interest rate benchmarks and issues related to migrating to new benchmarks with a view of drawing lessons relevant to the Indian context.\n\u2022\t Review of quality, setting methodology and dissemination time of the MIBOR. \n\u2022\t Review of the use of MIBOR for financial contracts and examine the need for transition to new benchmarks, if necessary.\no Identify associated risks and challenges \no Design of the proposed new benchmarks\no Roadmap for transition.\n\u2022\t Any other issue pertinent to the subject."

    "input": "Question: What role do derivatives play in financial markets, and how have interest rate derivatives evolved in India?",
    "output": "Derivatives play an important role in financial markets globally, allowing users to unbundle risks and allocate them to investors best suited to assume them. This facilitates hedging for businesses and enables financial institutions to offer a wider range of services, achieve greater efficiency, and avail of trading opportunities. Derivative contracts are broadly classified as exchange-traded or over-the-counter (OTC). Exchange-traded contracts are standardized and traded anonymously, while OTC derivatives offer tailor-made bilateral arrangements and choice of counterparty. The global derivative market is largely OTC, with interest rate derivatives (IRDs) accounting for 80% of outstanding OTC derivative contracts, as of March 2023. In India, interest rate and currency derivatives trade both OTC and on exchanges, while equity and commodity derivatives trade primarily on exchanges. The interest rate derivative market in India is largely an OTC market. Efforts to develop the market for IRDs in India started in 1999, when OTC rupee derivatives in the form of Interest Rate Swaps (IRS) and Forward Rate Agreements (FRAs) were first introduced. Banks/ primary dealers (PDs)/ All-India Financial Institutions (AIFIs) were permitted to undertake different types of plain vanilla FRAs/IRS using any domestic money or debt market rate as the benchmark rate, provided the methodology of computing the rate was objective, transparent and mutually acceptable to both counterparties. These derivatives enabled banks, PDs and AIFIs to hedge interest rate risk for their own balance sheet management and for market-making purposes. The market in FRAs/IRS evolved rapidly post introduction."

    "output": "From March 2000 to December 2002, the interest rate derivatives (IRD) market in India saw a jump from approximately 200 contracts amounting to ` 4,000 crore to 6,500 contracts for ` 1,50,000 crore. However, the market remained concentrated among select foreign banks, private sector banks, and primary dealers (PDs). The most prevalent IRD instrument was the plain vanilla fixed to floating swaps based on the NSE - Mumbai Interbank Offered Rate (MIBOR). While swaps based on benchmarks like the Mumbai Inter-Bank Forward Offered Rate (MIFOR), Mumbai Inter-Bank Offered Currency Swaps (MIOCS), Mumbai Inter-Bank Overnight Index Swaps (MIOIS), and Treasury Bill rates were also used, their volumes were small. Products with optionality such as caps/floors/collars were not permitted. In November 2002, a Working Group under Shri Jaspal Bindra was constituted by RBI to review progress and map further developments, recommending a phased introduction of rupee option products and enhancements, along with recommendations relating to market microstructure. Separately, Interest Rate Futures (IRF) were introduced in June 2003 on the NSE but failed to gain traction. In 2008, a Working Group under Shri V. K. Sharma further examined issues and made recommendations, but IRFs remained thinly traded. As OTC IRD market volumes grew, the Reserve Bank focused on ensuring market transparency, efficient price discovery, and market integrity, implementing measures to this end. In August 2007, banks and PDs were mandated to follow certain guidelines."

    "input": "Question: What measures were taken to ensure market transparency, efficient price discovery, market integrity, and ease of transacting in the OTC IRD market, and how did these measures contribute to the development of the market?",
    "output": "To ensure market transparency, efficient price discovery, market integrity, and ease of transacting, banks and PDs were mandated to report all inter-bank/PD trades in FRAs and IRS to a reporting platform developed by CCIL. Post-trade transparency was achieved through the dissemination of market information, such as rate and notional amount, via CCIL's website. This laid the foundation for a robust trade repository for OTC derivatives in the country. CCIL began offering settlement of IRS trades reported on its platform on a non-guaranteed basis in November 2008. In 2012, an RBI Working Group recommended the standardization of IRS contracts to facilitate centralized clearing and settlement, which CCIL commenced for MIBOR and MIOIS benchmarks in 2014, and for MIFOR IRS trades in 2018. Additionally, a framework for accreditation and regulation of brokers was established in August 2011, delegated to FIMMDA, enhancing liquidity by providing pre-trade anonymity. Electronic trading platforms (ETPs) like ICAP\u2019s i-stream and Clearcorp\u2019s ASTROID were introduced, further enhancing market liquidity. CCIL also started offering portfolio compression services to enhance the efficiency of domestic IRD markets."

    "input": "Question: What were the key developments and measures undertaken to evolve the Interest Rate Derivatives (IRD) market in India, including portfolio compression, legal recognition of netting, introduction of rupee option products, and additional measures to enhance liquidity?",
    "output": "In 2011, CCIL initiated portfolio compression for MIBOR OIS contracts, resulting in a 94.3% reduction of submitted trades. To date, CCIL has conducted 33 portfolio compression cycles for Rupee IRS derivative trades linked to MIBOR and five cycles for IRS trades linked to MIFOR, contributing to increased turnover in IRDs by enhancing capital efficiency.\n\nFurthermore, while the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007, recognized multilateral netting of derivative contracts centrally cleared, the Bilateral Netting of Qualified Financial Contracts Act was passed in September 2020, providing legal recognition to bilateral netting, addressing the issue of banks computing credit exposure on a gross basis.\n\nRupee Interest Rate Options (IROs) were introduced in 2016, following the recommendations of a Working Group. In 2018, Rupee interest rate swaptions were also permitted. Swaptions started being traded in domestic markets from 2021.\n\nTo further develop liquidity, users, other than banks and primary dealers, were permitted to undertake IRDs for both hedging and otherwise in 2019. This led to the increasing use of instruments such as bond FRAs and total return swaps (TRS). In December 2023, the RBI issued draft Directions to permit physically settled bond forwards."

    "input": "Question: How has the Rupee IRD market evolved, and what measures have been taken to enhance market integrity and address limitations in hedging practices?",
    "output": "The domestic market for Interest Rate Derivatives (IRDs) has seen the development of an active offshore market for Rupee IRS, specifically in the form of non-deliverable OIS (ND-OIS)/foreign currency settled OIS (FCS-OIS). To remove segmentation and expand the participant base, the RBI permitted non-residents to access the Rupee IRS market in India in 2019, and in 2022, allowed Indian banks and primary dealers to transact in the FCS-OIS market.\n\nThe evolution of the Rupee IRD market has been supported by measures ensuring market integrity, such as the availability of financial benchmarks administered by Financial Benchmarks India Pvt. Ltd. (FBIL), adherence to governance standards, accredited brokers, and transparency through trade reporting. The RBI issued a regulatory framework for the exchange of variation margin for non-centrally cleared derivatives (NCCDs) in 2022, and is finalizing a draft framework for the exchange of initial margin for NCCDs.\n\nDespite development through product and conduct regulations, the use of Rupee IRD contracts for hedging has been limited. To address this, revised Directions on Valuation of Investment Portfolio of banks, effective from April 01, 2024, enable banks to comply with accounting standards for derivatives (including hedge accounting). This alignment between economic needs and accounting practices is expected to incentivize the use of derivatives for hedging."

    "output": "Buoyed by various policy initiatives, efforts of market participants, the general development of the financial system, and the broader economy, the Rupee IRD market has grown over the years primarily to meet the hedging needs of the financial and non-financial sector. There has been a significant increase in the size of the market in recent years, as measured by the notional value of outstanding contracts which rose from ` 37 lakh crore in January 2021 to around ` 100 lakh crore in January 2024, with both inter-bank and client transactions increasing in tandem. Of this, MIBOR-based OIS contracts are the predominant instrument accounting for almost 86 per cent of the total notional value of outstanding contracts. The second most transacted derivative product is the MIFOR (now modified MIFOR) based IRS where the notional value of outstanding transactions stood at ` 8.1 lakh crore as of January 31, 2024. Other IRD instruments are also being transacted in the market, each developing in response to successive policy initiatives and different hedging needs of different types of users."

    "output": "As the domestic IRD market has been growing in recent years, so also has been the offshore market for Rupee IRDs in response to the growing interest of the global community in the Indian interest rate market. This is evident, for example, from the data on foreign currency settled MIBOR-based OIS trades (FCS-OIS) reported to the London Clearing House (LCH). The two markets had remained segmented with wide variation in the traded OIS rates in the domestic and offshore markets.\nIn 2019, RBI opened up access of non-residents to the domestic IRD market. Since then, non-residents have become prominent participants in the onshore MIBOR OIS market, with trading activity surpassing that of resident clients. The Price Value of a Basis Point (PVBP) utilization of non-residents has also increased over time, on account of rising interest in onshore rupee derivatives. In February 2022, RBI permitted banks in India to participate in the offshore markets."

A significant share of the MIBOR OIS, the most liquid instrument in the market, is traded electronically with price information on transactions being disseminated on a near real-time basis. The bulk of these contracts are centrally cleared. Trades in MIFOR / modified MIFOR are also gradually migrating to electronic trading platforms and about 40 per cent of these trades are centrally cleared. These developments have aided the efficiency of price discovery and made it easier to execute large trades, thereby increasing market depth (Charts 3.8 and 3.9)."

    "output": "A basis swap market has developed in many jurisdictions to enable the management of risks arising from different benchmarks. A basis swap essentially enables counterparties to the contract to exchange two floating rates referencing different benchmarks. The existence of a basis swap market is key to market makers being able to offer a wider range of IRDs to their clients. During the LIBOR transition, for example, basis swaps were extensively used to manage their LIBOR exposures, i.e., to convert LIBOR exposures to exposures to ARRs. In the post LIBOR world, the use of basis swaps referencing various ARRs has emerged to manage the basis risks arising out of the use of different ARRs."

    "output": "The Committee evaluated the growth of the IRD market in India against the backdrop of the evolving macroeconomy, an increasingly complex financial system, diversity in participation and developments in the legal and regulatory landscape. The Committee noted that a market in several types of Rupee derivatives has emerged in recent years to cater to different needs of participants. The market for MIBOR-based swaps is very liquid while reasonable liquidity has also developed in the market for MIFOR-based swaps with the transition to modified-MIFOR based swaps having been achieved smoothly. The measure to enable non-residents to access the Rupee OIS market for hedging or otherwise in 2019 and permitting banks and SPDs to access the FCS-OIS market since 2022 have enabled growth in client volumes while at the same time reducing segmentation between the onshore and the offshore markets. The Committee noted that since the Reserve Bank permitted market makers greater flexibility to offer innovative products to meet bespoke requirements of customers, the market for products like bond FRAs has developed primarily to meet the hedging needs of long-term investors in the bond market while products like TRS have developed to meet the needs of issuers of medium to long term corporate bonds. The Committee also noted that the broadening in participant base, especially the growing non-resident participation in the domestic IRD market, has added diversity, liquidity and depth to the market. Significant progress has also been made towards the development of market infrastructure in terms of transparency, electronic trading, central clearing of the more liquid products as well as governance of market-makers and benchmarks."

    "output": "A single category of interest rate derivative contract is unlikely to fully capture the varied interest rate risks representing the underlying interest rate variables, such as the monetary policy rate, the floating rate benchmark, or the interest rate risk prevalent in a government security. On the other hand, the presence of multiple rupee IRD contracts with adequate liquidity provides the market with the ability to manage its varied rupee interest rate risks."

    "output": "According to the Committee on MIBOR Benchmark, the pricing of corporate loans is also getting linked to the treasury bills rate, in particular to the 91 and the 182-day treasury bill rates. The committee felt that in certain cases appropriate instruments for hedging of the underlying interest rate risk may not be available and noted that the pricing of loans based on policy rates may expose the borrowers as well as banks to interest rate risks especially when interbank rates diverge from the policy rate. Therefore, the Committee felt the need for popularising market-determined benchmarks for linking of loans, including small-ticket advances, to facilitate the hedging of the underlying interest rate risk."

    "output": "The Report of the Committee on MIBOR Benchmark notes that developments have raised the need for instruments to efficiently manage varied interest rate risks encountered by different market participants. Regulatory enablers for product innovation since 2019 have facilitated the use of derivative contracts like bond FRAs and TRSs, but liquidity in these contracts remains limited and client-driven. Globally, especially in emerging markets, there's limited interest in hedging interest rate risk, particularly from the non-financial sector. Domestically, limited access for non-residents and hedging-only restrictions for resident users have been factors. Various product and regulatory restrictions on financial entities, such as NBFCs being limited to exchange-traded IRFs and mutual funds only accessing IRSs for hedging, further constrain participation. The Committee suggests sectoral regulators review these frictions to allow regulated entities to transact in all available IRDs for efficient hedging, with non-hedging transactions specified based on risk controls. The committee also discussed non-resident participation, noting that since 2019 non-resident participation has deepened market liquidity and increased the efficiency of price discovery in the domestic OIS market. The Committee felt that in the long run, allowing non-residents to transact in a wider suite of IRD instruments will make Indian markets more global, but this should be done gradually based on an assessment of evolving market conditions and subject to appropriate risk-controls, since Indian IRD markets, apart from MIBOR OIS, may not currently have the size and liquidity to absorb non-resident flows."

    "output": "The Committee felt that the current range of IRDs transacted in Indian markets remains insufficient for the hedging requirements of financial and non-financial participants. It assessed the suitability of MIBOR-based OIS to meet the diverse hedging needs of different stakeholders, noting MIBOR's role as a reflection of the RBI policy rate, allowing market participants to express views on monetary policy expectations. Consequently, MIBOR-based OIS has become a tool for both hedging interest rate risks and conveying expectations on monetary policy, unlike other jurisdictions with distinct instruments for different purposes. The Committee also discussed the use of MIBOR-based OISs to hedge interest rate risks, which can engender basis risks due to the spread between MIBOR and the policy rate or treasury bill rates, potentially impairing the efficiency of the hedge."

    "input": "Question: What factors influence the basis risk arising from the spread between the policy repo rate and MIBOR, and what other observations did the Committee make regarding the domestic IRD market and basis swap instruments?",
    "output": "The Committee noted that the basis risk arising out of the spread between the policy repo rate and MIBOR is expected to be limited given that the weighted average call rate is the operating target of monetary policy and MIBOR is based on call money market transactions. Nonetheless, as the experience of the last few years has demonstrated, the rates in call money market are significantly influenced by prevailing systemic liquidity conditions and can, move around the Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) corridor (and sometimes even beyond the corridor) depending upon liquidity conditions and prevalent demand / supply imbalances. This, however, risks impairing the efficiency of the MIBOR-based derivatives as an instrument for hedging.\n\nThe MIBOR and the treasury bill benchmarks are, on the other hand, fundamentally different benchmarks though both markets are affected by systemic liquidity conditions. One is based on overnight rates while the other is a term rate. Treasury bills being the rates at which the Government borrows are considered risk free rates while call money transactions are unsecured transactions between banks and primary dealers and therefore incorporate an element of credit risk premium.\n\nThe Committee also noted that, notwithstanding the above basis risks, the domestic IRD market has not evidenced transactions in basis swap instruments, which may be encouraged. In many other jurisdictions basis swaps have developed as an instrument to enable market participants to mitigate the risks associated with the spread or basis associated with different variable interest rates."

    "output": "The Committee deliberated on the need for IRDs based on term benchmark rates. Globally the preferred benchmark for the \u201cmain\u201d IRD has been a term benchmark, possibly reflecting that while overnight benchmarks serve the purpose of financial markets, particularly for expressing views on the expected movements of monetary policy rates, they may not be the most appropriate benchmark for meeting the hedging needs of all stakeholders in the financial and non-financial sectors. Overnight rates, anchored to policy rates of the central bank, may not be truly representative of marginal cost of funding for lenders. A constraint in the domestic market is the lack of an IRS instrument linked to a term benchmark rate, despite multiple term rates such as CD rates being published by FBIL. The \u201cmain\u201d IRS in the Korean market is linked to 3M CD rates."

    "output": "Over time, the Rupee IRS market has developed into one of the most liquid Interest Rate Derivatives (IRDs). However, the participant base has not increased commensurately. The participation in MIBOR OIS is concentrated amongst select foreign banks, private sector banks, and Primary Dealers (PDs), while the interest from other banks and clients (corporates, mutual funds, Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) etc.) has remained limited. In January 2024, the top six participants accounted for close to half of the total outstanding MIBOR OIS contracts in the interbank segment. While participation by non-residents has increased in the instrument, most of the transactions including in Foreign Currency Settlement-OIS (FCS-OIS), are with offshore market-makers rather than with the end users / clients.\n\nThe Committee also noted the risks associated with a large concentration of activity around a single benchmark under circumstances of a benchmark failure, where a financial benchmark becomes unreliable, inaccurate, or unrepresentative of the underlying market it is intended to measure."

    "output": "The MIBOR was first introduced by the National Stock Exchange (NSE) in 1998, publishing both the MIBOR and the Mumbai Interbank Bid Rate (MIBID). In 2002, FIMMDA partnered in disseminating MIBID/MIBOR, renaming the benchmark as FIMMDA-NSE MIBID/MIBOR. In 2014, a committee recommended changing the computation methodology from a polling process to one based on actual transactions and publishing a single weighted average traded rate. FBIL took over the administration of the benchmark in 2015, replacing \"FIMMDA-NSE Overnight MIBID/MIBOR\" with \"FBIL- Overnight MIBOR\".\n\nOver the past decades, the microstructure of money markets has evolved considerably due to several factors:\n\n(a) The call money market, initially the primary market for inter-institutional overnight lending and borrowing, saw the phasing out of non-bank participants (except primary dealers) beginning in 2001, following recommendations from the Committee on Banking Sector Reforms in 1998. Prudential limits on borrowing and lending in the call money market by banks and primary dealers were implemented on October 5, 2002.\n\n(b) Concurrently, non-banks gained wider access to repo markets. Mutual funds, driven by robust growth in debt fund AUM, became dominant lenders, accounting for around 60% of lending in the secured overnight money market and over 70% in the TREPS segment."

    "input": "Question: What initiatives were undertaken to establish a robust trading infrastructure for repo markets, and how have money market volumes changed over time?",
    "output": "A series of initiatives were implemented to establish a robust trading, clearing, and settlement infrastructure for repo markets. Repo transactions in government securities are now primarily conducted on Clearcorp Repo Order Matching System (CROMS) and Triparty Repo Dealing System (TREPS). These platforms, along with NDS-OM, are operated by Clearcorp Dealing Systems (India) Ltd., a CCIL subsidiary, and are governed under the Electronic Trading Platforms (Reserve Bank) Directions, 2018. Repo trades are settled by the CCIL under the DvP-III process alongside outright transactions in government securities to enhance liquidity and netting efficiency. These infrastructure arrangements incorporate near real-time dissemination of trade information, significantly increasing the convenience of executing large deals in secured money markets.\n\nMoney market volumes have experienced substantial growth, increasing from \u20b94.7 lakh crore in 2002-03 to \u20b9237.8 lakh crore in 2009-10 and further to \u20b91,313 lakh crore in 2022-23. Supported by policy initiatives that expanded non-bank access to the repo market and established efficient market infrastructure, the total turnover in the repo markets rose from \u20b9216 lakh crore in 2009-10 to \u20b91,282 lakh crore in 2022-23. As activity shifted to the secured segment, call money transaction volumes declined both relative to repo markets and in absolute terms. Call money market volumes have remained largely stagnant despite the overall growth of the money market. In 2023-24, average daily volumes in the call money market were \u20b910,600 crore, compared to \u20b94.4 lakh crore in the secured segment (TREPS and market repo). The share of call money transactions in overnight money markets has gradually decreased from over 20% in 2011-12 to below 2% in 2022-23, even with largely unchanged average daily trading volumes."

    "output": "The Committee examined the implications of developments in the structure of the money market for the robustness, reliability, and representativeness of the MIBOR benchmark. The Committee noted that the MIBOR, which is computed based on call money market transactions, is drawing on a progressively lower number and volume of transactions. Transaction volumes in similar uncollateralized instruments in certain other jurisdictions, such as the US, have remained broadly stable during the last few years. For example, the average daily turnover in the US Federal Funds market which stood at US$ 67 billion in 2016 remained largely unchanged at US$ 70 billion during 2021. In the UK, the average daily turnover of sterling unsecured money market deposit transactions (underlying the SONIA benchmark) increased from \u00a3 43 billion in 2016 to \u00a3 68 billion in 2023. While the overall call money market volumes are declining, the computation of the MIBOR is based on a narrow volume of call transactions, i.e., on trades transacted in the first hour of the trading day (Box II). On an average, such trades accounted for about 40 per cent of daily call."

    "input": "Question: How is the MIBOR (Mumbai Interbank Offer Rate) currently computed and published?",
    "output": "The MIBOR is computed and published daily by FBIL (Financial Benchmarks India Pvt. Ltd.). It is based on trades executed on the NDS-Call system in the first hour of trading (currently 9:00 to 10:00 AM) and is generally published at 10:45 AM. Only T+0 settlement deals are considered and fetched from the NDS-Call system immediately after the cut-off time. For any working day, the maturity of the deals considered for computation of FBIL Overnight MIBOR is the next Mumbai Business Day, excluding Saturdays. A minimum of 10 trades with an aggregate traded value of \u20b9 500 crore or more in the NDS-Call segment are required as a threshold. If these criteria are not met, the timeframe for computation is extended by 30 minutes, and if still not met, by another 30 minutes. If the criteria are still unmet after these extensions, a fallback mechanism is initiated. The weighted average rate (WAR) and standard deviation are calculated based on the first hourly traded data. Outliers are detected based on WAR+/-(3*Standard Deviation) criteria. MIBOR is then calculated based on the transactions adjusted for the outliers."

    "output": "In view of concerns regarding the MIBOR benchmark, the Committee undertook an assessment of its computation methodology over the last few years. Unlike LIBOR, which was based on polled information, the Committee noted that MIBOR is computed on actual transaction data from the NDS-Call system in the first hour (9:00 to 10:00 AM) on a daily basis. Data since 2016 indicated sufficient trade volume was generally available in the first hour to compute MIBOR, making fallback mechanisms rare. While drawing comfort from this, the Committee deliberated on possible approaches to reduce potential vulnerabilities associated with the benchmark to make MIBOR more robust and reliable."

As discussed earlier in the report, the computation of the MIBOR is currently based on a subset of call money market trades transacted during a day. The committee also considered three alternatives to increase the computation window in this regard:\n(a) Computing MIBOR based on the entire day\u2019s transactions;\n(b) Computing MIBOR based on the first two hours\u2019 transactions; and\n(c) Computing MIBOR based on the first three hours\u2019 transactions."

    "output": "Based on its analysis, the Committee on MIBOR Benchmark felt that increasing the computation window of MIBOR rate from the existing one hour to three hours will enhance the representativeness of the benchmark, as around 80 per cent of the deals in the call money market are transacted during this window. An increase in computation window, beyond three hours, may not significantly improve the representativeness further, as less than 10 per cent of the deals were transacted during this window in the last two years. Further, the Committee felt that increasing the computation window to full day may delay the publication of the benchmark to the end of the day or the morning of the next day, which may lead to challenges in the settlement of MIBOR OIS on payment day in the extant setup.\n\nThe empirical evidence indicates that, in the recent period, the deviation of the benchmark rate if the computation window is expanded to the first two to three hours is not significant from the current rate, while there is some impact if it is expanded to the entire day. Further, the Committee noted that the difference between the weighted average rate of call transactions during the last two hours and the extant MIBOR rate is significant. Therefore, inclusion of such deals in the MIBOR computation could invite undue volatility in the benchmark rate."

    "output": "The Committee discussed that while increasing the computation window to increase the share of transactions being considered for the computation of the MIBOR could make the MIBOR more representative and enhance its robustness, such a change was not without implications. Changing the computation methodology to include the entire day\u2019s transactions, for example, would result in the publication of the MIBOR after the end of the trading day and this could have implications for the functioning of the market, in particular for the functioning of the market for MIBOR-OIS. The same could also construe a material change in the methodology for the computation of the MIBOR with potential valuation and resultant legal implications for existing contracts based on the MIBOR.\n\nThe Committee was of the opinion that given the benefits of expanding the computation window for the MIBOR while being cognizant of the associated costs / risks, an expanded computation window to include trades in the first three hours could be examined. The Committee also felt that changing the computation of the MIBOR to include the entire day\u2019s call money market transactions may not be desirable. Earlier in the report, the committee noted that increasing the computation window of MIBOR rate from extant one hour to three hours will enhance the representativeness of the benchmark, as around 80 per cent of the deals in the call money market are transacted during this window."

    "input": "Question: What did the Committee recognize and discuss regarding the robustness and representativeness of benchmark reference rates, the potential vulnerabilities of MIBOR, and possible paths to address these issues?",
    "output": "The Committee recognized that a robust benchmark reference rate needs to be representative of the activities in the underlying market and provide an accurate indication of the market pulse. It also felt that all benchmarks are susceptible to weaknesses, albeit to varying extents, arising from the possibility of errors, bona fide or deliberate. The vulnerability of benchmarks also varies based on the liquidity and diversification of the underlying markets, the robustness of the market microstructure, etc., calling for the need for constant vigilance even in the most liquid of markets, further enhanced where the underlying markets are shallow, as is the case in the call money market. The Committee also discussed that the robustness and representativeness of any benchmark is enhanced depending on the liquidity in the underlying market and greater use of transaction data. It noted that, internationally, the response to LIBOR-related concerns has been to shift to alternate benchmark rates with wider participant bases (beyond banks) and higher liquidity. The Committee also noted that, globally the preferred benchmark for meeting the hedging needs of economic agents is a term benchmark. Against this backdrop and in view of the potential vulnerabilities of the MIBOR, as set out in Chapter 6 of this Report, as well as the challenges posed in hedging of long term interest rate risks and associated basis risks as discussed in Chapter 5 of this Report, the Committee discussed two potential paths to address these issues:\n(a) The need for transition away from the use of MIBOR to an alternate benchmark rate as the primary benchmark for IRD transactions.\n(b) The need for developing new IRD products based on term benchmarks to support the hedging needs of various stakeholders; and \nThe Committee also discussed the possibility of the co-existence of IRD markets based on overnight and term benchmarks (as is the case in several advanced economies) to support the needs of financial sector participants to express a view on monetary policy and to enable financial and non-financial entities to hedge their interest rate risks, respectively. The Committee examined the case of transitioning from the MIBOR to a potentially more robust alternate benchmark, as the primary underlying for interest rate derivatives. To this end, the Committee reviewed the extant interest rate related benchmarks, the methodology of their computation as well as their use in financial markets and by financial institutions."

    "output": "The Committee observed that there may be a need to review the existing benchmarks based on the overnight money market. As highlighted in the previous chapter, the microstructure of these markets has evolved considerably with collateralized markets becoming the dominant segment. The Committee noted that so far, there are two benchmark rates available based on overnight money markets \u2013 MIBOR and MROR, but none of them incorporate transactions from the TREP segment, even though the TREP segment constitutes around 70 per cent of the total money market transactions. Therefore, as benchmarks should be reflective of the current market dynamics, FBIL may develop a benchmark based on the secured money market (both basket repo and TREP), i.e., a Secured Overnight Rupee Rate (SORR). Akin to changes suggested for computation window for MIBOR, the proposed SORR benchmark may consider trades in first three hours of basket repo and TREP segments. For calculation of SORR, \u201cspecial repo\u201d transactions on the CROMS system may be excluded and only \u201cbasket repo\u201d transactions may be included because special repo transactions have the element of \u201cshort covering\u201d which may skew the rate calculation."

    "input": "Question: What factors did the Committee on MIBOR Benchmark consider when evaluating an alternate benchmark for Interest Rate Derivatives (IRDs)?",
    "output": "The Committee on MIBOR Benchmark considered several factors when evaluating an alternate benchmark for IRDs:\n\n1.  The Committee considered the need to develop another benchmark comprising of all transactions \u2013collateralized and uncollateralized, as a single benchmark for entire overnight markets. However, considering the composition of the markets, where repo markets account for 98 per cent of overall transactions, the Committee felt that such a benchmark would practically be very close to the secured benchmark.\n2.  The Committee discussed that any alternate benchmark considered for potential use as a benchmark for IRDs should be derived from a liquid market with a wider participant base. \n3.  The Committee felt that such a benchmark should therefore be based on overnight money market where the domestic money market liquidity is concentrated. \n4.  The Committee was of the opinion that the alternate benchmark will ideally have to be based on the collateralised segment of the overnight money markets (TREPS / basket repo with Government securities as underlying) given the representativeness of these markets which account for 98 per cent of volumes in the overnight money market segment and have a diversified participant base including non-banks such as mutual funds, insurance companies and corporates, in addition to banks and primary dealers. \n5.  The Committee also felt that the transition to such a benchmark, if decided upon, would also be least disruptive given that the liquidity in the IRD market has developed around an overnight benchmark. While the fundamental character of the TREPS / basket repo markets is different from the call money market on which the MIBOR is based, the markets perform essentially the same function of facilitating overnight borrowing and lending and short-term liquidity management. \n6.  The Committee assessed the rates derived from the TREPS / basket repo market vis-\u00e0-vis the call money market on the criteria of correlation and volatility, to assess their suitability as benchmark for overnight rates. A dynamic conditional correlation among the three segments of money market reflects very high degree of correlation for significant part of the time considered, although the correlation has evolved over time.\n7.  For basket repo and TREPS, transactions in the first three hours account for about 90 per cent and 50 per cent respectively of entire day\u2019s transactions (Tables 7.2 and 7.3). This would also ensure alignment in publication time of all overnight benchmark rates."

It recommended changing the computation methodology of MIBOR to include transactions based on the first three hours instead of the first hour, potentially making it more representative and reliable; this should be implemented by FBIL after examination and consultation. The Committee also reviewed the existing computational methodology for MIBOR and was satisfied with the practice followed by FBIL.\n\nFurthermore, based on trends in money markets, the Committee was of the opinion that the repo market in government securities (TREPS and market repo) may be more representative of the overnight market funding rate than the call money market. It recommended that FBIL develop a benchmark based on the secured money market (both basket repo and TREP) - Secured Overnight Rupee Rate (SORR). For the proposed SORR benchmark, FBIL may consider trades in the first three hours of the basket repo and TREP segments, aligning the publication time of all overnight benchmark rates. Also, there is a need to create conditions for development of IRD market around an alternate overnight benchmark rate \u2013 SORR. To begin with, FBIL may start computation and publication of the new benchmark, i.e., the SORR. Parallelly, FIMMDA may draw up the operational guidelines and market conventions for transactions in IRD based on SORR, and work towards popularizing the benchmark among market participants.

In the interim, market participants may continue using IRDs based on both the benchmarks, depending on their preference.\n\nTo increase the participant base in the domestic IRD market, the Committee noted that non-resident participation in the domestic OIS market has deepened market liquidity and increased the efficiency of price discovery. They also noted the need for harmonizing regulations and permissibility of various financial sector participants to access the domestic IRD market.\n\nThe Committee recommended that the access of non-residents to the onshore IRD markets, beyond MIBOR OIS, for purposes other than hedging may be permitted in a gradual manner based on an assessment of the evolving market conditions and subject to appropriate risk-controls.\n\nThe sectoral regulations for various financial sector participants (NBFCs, mutual funds, insurance companies, etc.) may be reviewed to provide flexibility to these institutions to manage their interest rate risks with flexibility and efficiency.\n\nRegarding the pricing of loans, the Committee noted that banks are increasingly linking their portfolio of personal, retail, and MSME loans to the policy repo rate. The Committee observed that loans are typically priced based on inter-bank money market rates and not policy rates. The Committee recommended that pricing of loans based on policy rates makes it challenging for borrowers to hedge their interest rate risks especially when interbank rates diverge from the policy rate."

    "output": "The Committee on MIBOR Benchmark made the following recommendations:\n\n8.4.1 Banks may review the possibility of pricing of small ticket advances based on market-determined benchmarks, including term benchmarks, for example, benchmark based on treasury bill rates, to facilitate the hedging of the underlying interest rate risk using appropriate IRDs based on the underlying benchmark (Para 5.9).\n\n8.4.2 Concerted efforts to develop a basis swap market also need to be made. FIMMDA can set up a Working Group of market participants to deliberate on the various aspects of developing a market for basis swaps and also finalise market conventions in this regard (Para 5.18).\n\n8.4.3 Concerted efforts should be made to develop IRD products linked to benchmarks based on term rates (such as the treasury bill rates) as also to develop liquidity in these products. As a first step, FBIL may also consider expanding the bouquet of term benchmarks in consultation with market participants. FIMMDA may develop market conventions for such products in consultation with market participants (Para 5.19).\n\n8.5 The Committee noted the significant role played by market infrastructure (e.g., trade reporting and dissemination, electronic trading and central clearing) in the development of the domestic IRD market by ensuring transparency, a level-playing field for smaller market participants and ensuring efficiency. In view of the same, the Committee recommends the following (Para 7.18):\n\n8.5.1 CCIL may examine making electronic trading available for a larger bouquet of IRD products. To begin with, it could provide facilities for electronic trading on treasury bills linked swaps and basis swaps.\n\n8.5.2 CCIL may evaluate the possibility of introducing central clearing for such products.\n\n8.5.3 While all OTC derivative transactions are reported to the trade repository operated by CCIL, the dissemination of anonymized trade information on IRD products related to alternate benchmarks may be reviewed / enhanced."

    "input": "Question: What are the key points of the executive summary regarding asset reconstruction companies (ARCs)?",
    "output": "The executive summary highlights the following:  Against the backdrop of significant build-up of non-performing assets (NPAs) in the financial system, asset reconstruction companies (ARCs) are expected to play a critical role. The ARC framework is designed to allow originators to focus on their core function of lending, by removing sticky stressed financial assets from their books. ARCs act as the primary agent for recovery upon acquisition of such financial assets. The ARC framework is also designed to help borrowers revive their businesses, which protects the viable and productive assets of the economy and often ensures a better return to banks/ financial institutions (FIs), collectively referred to as \u2018 lenders\u2019, from their stressed assets. However, data shows that the performance of the ARCs has been lacklustre, both in terms of ensuring recovery and revival of businesses. Banks and other investors could recover only about 14.29% of the amount owed by borrowers in respect of stressed assets sold to ARCs during the FY 2004 - FY 2013 period. Similarly, data shows that approximately 80% of the recovery made by ARCs has come through deployment of measures of reconstruction that do not necessarily lead to revival of businesses. There are multiple factors behind the sub-optimal performance of the ARC Sector. These primarily include vintage NPAs being passed on to ARCs, lack of debt aggregation, non-availability of additional funding for stressed borrowers, difficulty in raising of funds by the ARCs on their balance sheet, etc. Also, ARCs have lacked focus on both recovery and acquiring necessary skill sets for holistic resolution of distressed borrowers. Considering the challenges impacting the performance of the ARC Sector, the Committee to Review the Working of Asset Reconstruction Companies was constituted to undertake a comprehensive review of the working of ARCs. The terms of reference of the Committee were as under: (i) Review of existing legal and regulatory framework appl icable to ARCs and recommend measures to improve efficacy of ARCs; (ii) Review of role of ARCs in resolution of stressed assets including under Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code (IBC), 2016;"

    "input": "Question: What recommendations did the Committee make regarding the sale of stressed assets to ARCs, transparency, uniformity of processes, debt aggregation, and the role of the Reserve Bank?",
    "output": "The Committee made several recommendations. To incentivize lenders to sell financial assets to ARCs early, it suggests allowing lenders to amortize losses on sale over two years. To optimize value realization, it recommends a higher threshold of investment in Security Receipts (SRs) for lenders. For accounts of Rs.100 crore and above in default, lenders' resolution plans should explicitly evaluate sale/auction to ARCs. For older NPAs without a resolution plan and not identified for sale, the reason for exclusion should be documented.\n\nTo enhance transparency and uniformity in selling stressed assets, the Committee suggests an online platform, potentially using the Secondary Loan Market Association (SLMA) infrastructure. For accounts above Rs.500 crore, two bank-approved external valuers should determine liquidation and fair market value; for accounts between Rs.100-500 crore, one valuer should be engaged. A high-level committee should approve the reserve price, with authority to approve corresponding loan write-offs.\n\nFor debt aggregation, the Committee recommends expanding Section 5 of the SARFAESI Act to allow ARCs to acquire financial assets from entities beyond banks and financial institutions, as notified by the Reserve Bank. The Reserve Bank may consider permitting ARCs to acquire financial assets from all regulated entities, including AIFs, FPIs, AMCs, and all NBFCs (including HFCs) irrespective of asset size and from retail investors."

    "output": "The Committee recommends that ARCs should be allowed to sponsor SEBI registered AIFs with the objective of using these entities as an additional vehicle for facilitating restructuring/ recovery of the debt acquired by them. In cases where 66% of lenders (by value) decide to accept an offer by an ARC, the same may be binding on the remaining lenders and it must be implemented within 60 days of approval by majority lenders (66%), mandating 100% provisioning on the loan outstanding if a lender fails to comply. The planning period should be elongated to one year from the existing six months. Additionally, in cases where ARCs have acquired 66% of debt of a borrower, the Act should provide for two years of moratorium on proceedings against the borrower by other authorities and Government dues will be deferred. The equity pertaining to a borrower company may be allowed to be sold by lenders to ARCs which have acquired the borrower\u2019s debt, and ARCs may be allowed to participate in the IBC process as a Resolution Applicant. In the interest of giving impetus to listing and trading of SRs, the list of eligible qualified buyers may be further expanded to include HNIs with minimum investment of Rs.1 crore, corporates (Net Worth -Rs.10 crore & above), all NBFCs."

    "input": "Question: Why is a sound banking system essential, and what challenges does the Indian banking system face regarding Non-Performing Assets (NPAs)?",
    "output": "A sound banking system is an essential requirement for maintaining financial stability in any country. One of the parameters of soundness is the level of non-performing assets (NPAs) in the banking system. In this context, the Indian banking system has often been saddled with high levels of NPAs, affecting the profitability and capital position of banks, especially public sector banks (PSBs). This has been one of the factors leading to some level of risk aversion among the banks and thereby deceleration of credit growth in the country in recent years. The level of gross NPAs (GNPAs) of scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) stood at 7.5% at the end of March 2021. The Financial Stability Report of July 2021 published by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) indicates that the GNPA ratio of SCBs may transition to 9.80% in the baseline scenario by March 2022 and may increase to 10.36% and 11.22% under the other stress scenarios. Such a high level of NPAs in the economy can further decelerate growth of credit in the economy and can potentially undermine the stability of the financial system.\n\nIn view of its importance for the health of the banking system, management of NPAs has been attracting attention from the RBI and the Government for quite some time now. A chronological evolution of important legal and regulatory frameworks for handling of stressed assets is given in the Figure A1 below. The first such significant legal framework to manage the stress in the banking system was the Sick Industrial Companies (Special Provisions) Act, 1985 (SICA). It was enacted for timely detection of sickness in industrial units and to undertake speedy action to resolve the insolvency of sick units through a Board of experts, namely the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR). SICA failed to meet its objective due to delays caused by legal suits and lack of timely decisions by the stakeholders and, therefore, was finally repealed in the year 2003. Related provisions of this Act were added in the Companies Act, 2013 and the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) took over the functions of BIFR. Insolvency resolution frameworks as a tool for handling stressed assets culminated into the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (IBC). IBC was enacted as a single code to consolidate the existing frameworks for insolvency and bankruptcy and has emerged as a significant tool for recovery."

    "input": "Question: What legislations and regulatory frameworks have been implemented to facilitate debt recovery and handle stressed assets in the Indian banking system?",
    "output": "Other noteworthy legislations which aimed to facilitate recovery of debt for banks and Financial Institutions include the Recovery of Debt due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act, 1993 (RDDBFI Act) and the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest (SARFAESI) Act, 2002. The former Act attempts to provide speedy recovery through tribunals, namely, Debt Recovery Tribunals (DRTs) whereas the latter allows secured creditors to enforce their security interest without the intervention of the courts. The SARFAESI Act also led to creation of asset reconstruction companies (ARCs) as a permanent institutional arrangement to handle the stressed financial assets of banks and other financial institutions.\nRBI has also been providing regulatory frameworks to banks for efficient handling of stressed assets in their books. The Corporate Debt Restructuring framework envisaged vide circular dated August 23, 2001 provided a mechanism for timely and transparent restructuring of debt of viable entities, outside the purview of BIFR, DRT and other legal proceedings. This framework aimed at preserving viable corporates and minimizing losses to the creditors through an orderly and coordinated restructuring programme. Another major regulatory intervention was the \u201cFramework for Revitalising Distressed Assets in the Economy\u201d dated January 30, 2014. This framework attempted to centralise reporting and dissemination of information on large credit, incentivise lenders to agree collectively and quickly to a restructuring plan, provide improvements in restructuring process, etc. This was followed by various schemes of restructuring prescribed by RBI, namely, Flexible Structuring of Long Term."

    "output": "RBI had schemes such as Flexible Structuring of Long Term Project Loans, Strategic Debt Restructuring Scheme, and Scheme for Sustainable Structuring of Stressed Assets (S4A). Due to the mixed success of these schemes, RBI issued new guidelines vide the \u201cPrudential Framework for Resolution of Stressed Assets\u201d dated June 7, 2019. The new guidelines provide a framework for early recognition, reporting, and time-bound resolution of stressed assets and withdraw the aforementioned frameworks and schemes. Charts A1 and A2 depict the use of various channels by banks for recovery of their NPAs. Data indicates that after their introduction in 2003, ARCs have been a major channel of recovery for banks until FY19. In FY20, banks took more NPAs for resolution through IBC compared to the ARC channel. Data also suggests that from FY19 onwards, recovery through IBC has been greater than the recovery through ARCs (Chart A2)."

    "instruction": "Answer the question based on the provided context from the financial report.",
    "input": "Question: What are the reasons banks prefer ARCs, and what factors drive the recent shift towards IBC for NPA resolution?",
    "output": "Banks prefer ARCs due to three primary reasons. First, ARCs allow banks/FIs to focus on their core function of lending by removing stressed assets, freeing up capital and management. Second, ARCs manage recovery for lenders by acting as the manager of the stressed assets when lenders invest in security receipts (SRs). Third, ARCs can help borrowers revive their businesses, which protects viable assets and ensures better returns for lenders.\n\nThe recent shift towards IBC is driven by two factors: IBC promises time-bound and optimal recovery for creditors along with borrower insolvency resolution, and the ARC sector's performance has been lacklustre in both ensuring recovery and reviving businesses."

    "input": "Question: What factors contribute to the sub-optimal performance of the ARC sector, and why is the ARC model still considered relevant?",
    "output": "The overall performance of the ARC Sector has left much to be desired, with rescheduling of payment of debts involved only in 19.9% of the recovery made by ARCs. While it would be incorrect to assume that the problems of the ARC sector are entirely of its own making, the ageing of NPAs before their sale may be contributing to poor recovery. This gets further aggravated by lack of debt aggregation. Revival of stressed business typically requires additional funding which is difficult to come by for old NPAs. Inadequate capital at ARC level and the regulatory prescription limiting the extent of funds that could be raised from external investors through securitization, seems to have made ARCs\u2019 attempt at revival of businesses even more difficult, and ARCs\u2019 lack of skill sets in turning around borrowers cannot be ignored.\nDespite the reshaping of the ecosystem available for lenders for handling of stressed assets and the ARC sector\u2019s sub-optimal performance and its challenges, the ARC model remains relevant as a private sector led permanent institutional framework for out-of-court resolution of stressed assets of the financial sector. Also, the ARC model, uniquely, allows investors to hold on to the upside of stressed assets in uncertain times through issuance of security receipts. However, for the model to remain sustainable, ARCs need to focus on turning around borrowers and not merely making recoveries. ARCs also need to acquire differentiated skill sets, and resources vis-\u00e0-vis the selling lenders in resolving stressed assets. Such empowered ARCs would better serve the needs of the financial sector and economy in general."

    "output": "The genesis of ARCs in India can be traced back to several key committees. The Committee on Banking Sector Reforms of 1991 (Narasimham Committee I) had proposed an Asset Reconstruction Fund (ARF) to address the NPA crisis by taking over bad assets from banks, but this recommendation was not implemented. The current ARC model is rooted in the recommendations of the Committee on Banking Sector Reforms of 1998 (Narasimham Committee II), which emphasized the need to address the large backlog of NPAs through financial restructuring. This committee suggested transferring doubtful and loss assets to an ARC, which would issue 'NPA Swap Bonds' to banks. It also recommended allowing ARCs to be set up by banks or in the private sector, with tax incentives similar to venture capital, and access to Debt Recovery Tribunals (DRTs). Another important committee was the Expert Committee for Recommending Changes in the Legal Framework concerning Banking System (Andhyarujina Committee) (1999-2000), which also shaped the current form of the ARC model."

    "input": "Question: What was the recommendation of the committee that recommended a legal framework for securitization, and how did it influence the establishment of ARCs in India?",
    "output": "The committee, inter alia, had recommended a legal framework for securitisation and recognised that securitisation as a product provides many benefits to the originator, the investor and the financial system in general. The Committee had examined each stage of securitisation, viz., the transfer or assignment or vesting or transmission of financial assets, the form and the nature of special purpose vehicles, the issue of transferable receipts, and enunciated the legal initiatives required. The current framework of securitisation under the SARFAESI Act is based on the Committee\u2019s draft Securitisation Bill. Subsequently, The Government of India enacted the SARFAESI Act in 2002 and paved the way for setting up ARCs in India. The Act envisaged that ARCs would be registered and regulated by RBI. Accordingly, initial guidelines were issued by RBI in April 2003. The first ARC, namely, Asset Reconstruction Company (India) Limited, was also registered in 2003. As on date, there are 28 ARCs in operation. As on March 31, 2021, the cumulative AUM of the Sector stood at approximately Rs.5.2 lakh crore in terms of book value acquired and the cumulative capital at play, as measured in terms of NOF, of the Sector stood at approximately Rs.9.8 thousand crore."

    "input": "Question: What are the key design principles pertaining to ownership, method of transfer, and sourcing/valuation of stressed assets that underlie international Asset Management Companies (AMCs)?",
    "output": "Fundamentally, the design of specialized institutions like AMCs has been influenced by the nature and extent of the crisis faced by a country. However, there are some general key design principles, pertaining to ownership of AMCs, method of transfer of stressed assets, sourcing and valuation of stressed assets, etc., that underlie the international AMCs. A brief overview includes:\n\n(a) Ownership \u2013 There are various models of ownership across the world, including public, private, or public-private partnership (PPP). The \u2018transfer price\u2019 (price at which NPAs are transferred to the AMC) plays a critical role in deciding the ownership structure. Setting up a private AMC implies that the \u2018transfer price\u2019 will be the \u2018market price\u2019 of the NPA, potentially leading to large haircuts for banks and impacting their capital. SAREB AMC in Spain was established as a private for-profit company in 2012. A public AMC allows for a \u2018transfer price\u2019 above the economic value of an NPA, but may lead to losses for the AMC. KAMCO in Korea and Danaharta in Malaysia are examples of public AMCs. PPP models represent a compromise between upfront capital provision to banks and eventual losses to the AMC. NAMA in Ireland, set up in 2009, had a private/public hybrid ownership.\n\n(b) Sourcing of NPA \u2013 Centralized AMCs are set up when the NPAs arise due to systemic problems. A public AMC is more likely in such cases, as the private sector may lack the financial capacity or coordination to address system-wide NPAs. Centralized AMCs offer consistency in workout practices and greater bargaining power for legal changes to facilitate loan recovery. KAMCO in Korea and Danaharta in Malaysia were centralized AMCs."

    "input": "Question: What are some key considerations and design possibilities regarding Asset Management Companies (AMCs) and Asset Reconstruction Companies (ARCs), based on international experience?",
    "output": "Based on international experience, there are several key considerations and design possibilities for Asset Management Companies (AMCs) and Asset Reconstruction Companies (ARCs):\n\n(a) Ownership \u2013 There are various models of ownership across the world. Under these models, the ownership could be public, private or public-private partnership (PPP). The \u2018transfer price\u2019 (price at which NPAs are transferred to the AMC) plays a critical role in deciding whether an AMC is floated as a public or private entity. Setting up a private AMC implies that the \u2018transfer price\u2019 will be the \u2018market price\u2019 of the NPA. Setting up a public AMC would give the flexibility to have a \u2018transfer price\u2019 above the economic value of an NPA. A similar trade-off also exists when AMCs are planned under the PPP model where a compromise between upfront provision of capital to banks and accepting eventual losses to AMC is made by the authorities.\n\n(b) Sourcing of NPA \u2013 Centralised AMCs are set up when the NPAs arise due to systemic problems. Bank-specific AMCs are set up when NPA issues are limited to a few individual banks. An example of a bank-specific AMC framework is Sweden where Securum and Retrieva were established in 1992 to work out the NPAs of Nordbanken and Gota Bank, respectively.\n\n(c) Voluntary vs mandatory transfer \u2013 In order to counter the reluctance of banks to recognize losses upfront while dealing with a systemic NPA problem, the option of mandatory transfer to AMC is used. In other scenarios, voluntary transfer is used, especially if not all banks are affected by NPA problems. Voluntary transfer allows for a level playing field across banks so that banks transferring bad assets to the AMC do not gain an unfair advantage over the others, by strengthening their balance sheets more than their peers.\n\n(d) Valuing of NPA in the books of AMC \u2013 When AMCs are used for warehousing of the assets, an important consideration is how to account for the assets acquired. If these are valued at fair value, short-term mark-to-market price variations can adversely affect their value, defeating one of the objectives of putting these in AMCs. On the other hand, keeping the assets at book value can reduce the AMC\u2019s incentive to dispose them off and, hence, unduly prolong the life of the asset.\n\nNaturally, the varied design possibilities imply that the performance of an AMC/ARC like entity can be judged only against the objective for which it has been established. However, international experience suggests that the performance generally depends on the operational independence, adequacy of resources, technical competence and the type and quality of assets the se specialised institutions acquire. In this respect, the technical competence of these entities becomes extremely important. Typically, these specialised institutions acquire bad assets which the originators had failed to keep at performing levels. Therefore, the only way they would be able to extract value from such assets is if they have some comparative advantage over the originators in terms of management skills. In the absence of any comparative advantage over the lenders , AMC will only serve the limited purpose of cleaning up banks\u2019 balance sheet s and will eventually becom e ineffective. In th is sense, it is imperative that these specialised institutions are differentially empowered though legal and regulatory frameworks."

    "output": "ARCs are registered and regulated under the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest (SARFAESI) Act. They acquire financial assets from banks/ FIs either on their own books or in the books of a trust set up for the purpose of securitisation and/ or reconstruction. Section 10 of the Act outlines the other permissible activities of the ARCs. Accordingly, ARCs are permitted to undertake only the business of asset reconstruction, securitisation and other fee-based business as enumerated under Section 10(1) of the Act. Any other activity can be undertaken by these entities only with the prior approval of RBI. Some of the important provisions of the Act specifically pertaining to ARCs are enumerated below:\nSection 3 Registration of ARCs\nSection 4 Cancellation of Certificate of Registration\nSection 5 Acquisition of Rights or Interest in Financial Assets\nSection 7 Issue of Security by Raising of Receipts or Funds by ARCs\nSection 8 Exemption from Registration of Security Receipt\nSection 9  Measures for Asset Reconstruction\nSection 10 Other Functions of ARC\nSection 12 Power of RBI to determine Policy and issue Directions\nSection 12A Power of RBI to call for Statements and Information\nSection 12B Power of RBI to carry out Audit and Inspection\nSection 30A  Power of Adjudicating Authority to impose Penalty\nSection 30B Appeal against Penalties\nSection 30C Appellate Authority. Section 2(1)(c) and Section 2(1)(m) of the Act define the terms \u2018bank\u2019 and \u2018financial institution(FI)\u2019, respectively. For the purpose of the Act, bank means a banking company as defined under Section 5(c) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (B R Act), or a corresponding new bank as defined under Section 5(da) of B R Act, or the State Bank of India, or a multi -state co-operative bank. The Central Government has been empowered by the Act to notify any other class of banks for the purpose of this Act. FI under the Act includes public financial institution as defined in Companies Act, 2013, International Finance Corporation established under the International Finance Corporation (Status, Immunities and Privileges) Act, 1958, specified institutions under Section 2(h)(ii) of RDDBFI Act, a debenture trustee registered with"

    "output": "According to Section 5(1) of the Act, ARCs can acquire financial assets from banks and FIs as defined under the Act. Another significance of an entity (e.g. a NBFC) being classified as FI under the Act is that it also gets enforcement powers with respect to secured financial assets under Section 13 besides the eligibility to sell financial assets to ARCs. Section 7 of the Act empowers ARCs to issue security receipts (SRs) and only qualified buyers (QBs) are permitted to acquire such SRs. Section 2(1)(u) of the Act defines QBs to include a financial institution, insurance company, bank, state financial corporation, state industrial development corporation, ARC or any asset management company making investment on behalf of mutual fund or a SEBI registered foreign institutional investor, any category of non -institutional investors as may be specified by RBI or any other body corporate as may be specified by SEBI.\nARCs for the purpose of securitisation create trusts which are governed by the provisions of the Indian Trust Act, 1882. Section 7(2A) of the SARFAESI Act specifies that such trusts are to be managed by ARCs, and ARCs shall hold the assets in trust for the benefit of the QBs . ARC regulations require that ARCs, as trustees, compulsorily invest and remain invested in at least 15% of the SRs of each class till the redemption of all the SRs issued by them under each scheme. ARCs skin in the game helps in aligning the interest of QBs (beneficiary) and the ARCs(trustee). Selling lenders may also acquire SRs as part of the consideration for transfer of assets to the trust. In fact, this has been the dominant practice till 2016. Typical transactions involved in securitisation done by ARCs are indicated in the Figure C1."

For Doubtful assets: (i) 100% provision is required to the extent the asset is not covered by the estimated realisable value of security; (ii) An additional 50% of the remaining outstanding amount is also required. For Loss assets: (i) the entire asset shall be written off; (ii) if the asset is retained in the books, 100% shall be provided for.\n\nIncome recognition guidelines state that yield on SRs and upside income should be recognized only after full redemption of SRs. Management fees should be calculated as a percentage of the net asset value (NAV) at the lower end of the range specified by the Credit Rating Agency.\n\nThe Act empowers the RBI under Section 9(2) to issue guidelines on measures for reconstruction of assets.

    "input": "Question: How do ARCs manage the recovery from asset resolution and what determines the management fee?",
    "output": "ARCs' efforts towards resolution of assets results in redemption of SRs. From the recovery made by ARCs, they claim the management fee for managing the assets, expenses and incentives, if any, from the respective trusts. Residual recovery is used to redeem the SRs issued to the QBs. Residual recovery in excess of the acquisition cost, generally referred to as \u2018upside income\u2019, is distributed among the QBs and ARCs as per the agreed terms. Management fee of ARCs is based on the NAV of the SRs. NAV in turn depends on the rating obtained from a SEBI registered Credit Rating Agency (CRA). ARCs are required to obtain the initial rating within a period of six months of acquisition of assets. Thereafter, the rating is reviewed by a CRA on half yearly basis. Rating is given in terms of 'recovery rating scale' which has an associated range of probable recovery expressed in percentage terms. NAV is arrived at by multiplying the face value of outstanding SRs with the lower end of the said range. Management fee is to be recognised on accrual basis and is to be reversed, if not realised within 180 days."

    "output": "The business of ARCs involves acquisition of stressed assets from lenders and recovery using various measures of asset reconstruction, and it typically also involves securitisation of acquired assets. Acquisition of assets by ARCs, in terms of book value, grew at a CAGR of 27.2% for the period FY04 to FY21. A considerable jump in acquisition was seen in FY14, followed by an overall upward trend over the succeeding years. Data shows that overall 79.8% of assets flowing into the ARC sector has been from the banks. Assets acquired from PSBs alone constituted 51.6% of the total assets acquired by the ARC sector. However, FY17 onwards, ARCs have been acquiring financial assets from a diverse set of entities. NBFCs have emerged as a significant class of sellers of stressed assets since the notification of select NBFCs as FIs for the purpose of Act in FY17. During the period FY17-FY21 acquisition from NBFCs grew at a CAGR of 87.9%. In fact, in FY21, NBFCs were the largest supplier of stressed assets among the eligible entities. The emergence of NBFCs as a significant class of sellers can be attributed to multiple factors, including the Central Government notifying an increasing number of NBFCs as FIs (currently, all NBFCs with an asset size of Rs.100 crore and above are notified as FIs) and the liquidity crunch faced by the NBFC sector around FY19."

    "output": "The increase in NBFCs\u2019 share in the supply of financial assets to ARCs can be partly attributed to the shrinking of banks\u2019 sale of financial assets to ARCs. Public Sector Banks' (PSBs) sales to ARCs have been declining from FY19 onwards. One factor behind this decline may be the introduction of progressive provisioning for banks\u2019 Security Receipt (SR) based deals, which was introduced via RBI circular dated September 1, 2016, and came into full force from FY19 onwards. A comparison between the Gross Non-Performing Assets (GNPA, including assets sold to ARC) of scheduled commercial banks and ARC\u2019s acquisition of financial assets from banks for the period of FY08 to FY19 indicates that post-FY14, there has been a downward trend in the percentage of NPAs sold to ARCs despite the upward trend in the level of GNPA in SCBs. Apart from progressive provisioning, the emergence of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) as an alternative resolution mechanism may have also contributed to this trend."

    "output": "From FY04 to FY13, Security Receipts (SRs) issued by the ARC sector accounted for 68.6% of the total value of SRs issued. However, the redemption of SRs issued during this period, as a percentage of the book value of stressed assets acquired, was only 14.29%. This means that banks and other investors could recover only about 14% of the amount owed by their borrowers. This data, combined with the fact that a significant portion of SRs have had to be written off, indicates two issues with the current market: low rates of redemption and inflated acquisition costs. The discount rate on book value has been high. It also suggests the importance of creating incentives to ensure that the price discovery process yields the true value of SRs, minimizing write-offs and aligning the discount to asset book value with the realisable value of the assets sold."

    "input": "Question: What factors deter lenders from selling stressed assets to ARCs, and what incentives can be offered to encourage such sales, particularly for assets with low vintage?",
    "output": "One of the significant deterrents to the sale of stressed assets by lenders to ARCs is that they are required to book the losses on an immediate basis. This especially acts as a deterrent for the sale of recent (low vintage) NPAs with lower levels of provisioning on the lenders\u2019 books. On the other hand, when lower vintage NPAs are assigned to ARCs, the chances of revival/maximization of recovery are higher. ARCs may be able to resolve such NPAs through revival of business before resorting to other legal options for recovery. In order to incentivize lenders to sell stressed assets, especially with a focus on those assets with low vintage, certain options may be considered, including extending the dispensation to allow banks to spread the loss on the sale of financial assets to ARCs over a period of two years, subject to suitable disclosures in the published accounts. Currently, on the sale of an asset below Net Book Value, lenders are required to provide for the shortfall at the time of sale. However, as per guidelines dated February 26, 2014, as an incentive for the early sale of NPAs, RBI had given a dispensation to banks for amortizing the shortfall on the sale of NPAs to ARCs, over a period of two years. The dispensation was valid up to March 31, 2015, but was later extended till March 31, 2016 vide circular dated May 21, 2015. Subsequently vide circular dated June 13, 2016, for assets sold between April 1, 2016 to March 31, 2017, banks were allowed to amortize the shortfall over a period of four quarters."

    "output": "Gross Exposure (A) Rs.100 \nProvisioning (B) Rs.15 \nNet Exposure (C=A-B) Rs.85 \nSale Consideration (D)  Rs.50 \nLoss at the time of Sale (E=C-D) Rs.35 \nProvisioning required in terms of current guidelines is Rs.35 on sale. Recommended guidelines for provisioning are: Year 1 @50% of Loss : Rs.17.50, Year 2 @50% of Loss : Rs.17.50. With effect from April 1, 2018, where the investment by a bank is more than 10% of SRs backed by assets sold by itself, the provisions held in respect of these SRs will be subject to a floor; this floor shall be progressive provisioning as per extant asset classification and provisioning norms. Provisioning requirement in such cases will be the higher of the provisioning rate required in terms of NAV declared by the ARC and provisioning rate as applicable to the underlying loans, assuming that the loans notionally continued in the books of the bank. These provisioning requirements aim to promote investments in SRs by the non-originator entities, thereby ensuring a more realistic price discovery. In cases where majority investment in SRs (say 51% or more) is through external parties (ARC and investors, other than lenders), the economic model presented in Annex III suggests that market transactions would have ensured a realistic price discovery. For such transactions, the Committee recommends that provisioning on residual SRs held by the selling banks may be made on the basis of NAV declared by the CRA and not as per IRACP norms. This would incentivize banks to sell financial assets to ARCs. The threshold of 51% is sensitive to the cost of capital of the investors, the rate of management fees, and the value created by the ARC through its reconstruction activities. As the market matures, we expect the risk of holding SRs to fall, thus reducing the cost of capital. Consequently, the levels of management fees are likely to drop. Both developments would increase the threshold of investment by external parties that would ensure discovery of true value. In parallel, more effective reconstruction activities would decrease the threshold. Hence, the Committee recommends that the 51% threshold may be applicable for two years and increased to 76% after due consideration of the various factors involved."

When substantial investment in SRs (say 51% or more) is by investors other than the lenders, provisioning on SRs held by the lenders may be done based on net asset value declared by the ARC. The threshold of 51% may be applicable for two years and increased to 76% thereafter. Lenders may be permitted to sell accounts reported as SMAs to ARCs to enable early assignment of debt and better reconstruction of stressed assets. This will also facilitate more efficient debt aggregation where the exposure to the same borrower is classified differently by different lenders, depending on the record of recovery. It is likely that SMA-0 and SMA-1 assets sold to ARCs could be reconstructed mainly through revival of the business whereas reconstruction of SMA-2 assets may also involve enforcement of security if the account is subsequently classified as NPA. At the same time, SMA borrowers need to be protected from precipitate enforcement of security interest by ARCs which may arbitrarily classify them as NPAs for enforcing security."

The endeavour should be to make the auction process transparent and robust. Industry associations, such as the IBA, may provide a process document to selling banks/ FIs for ensuring certainty and transparency of auctions conducted by them. The auction mechanism should involve multidimensional bidding whereby winners should be decided based on qualitative and quantitative parameters, such as total deal value, cash proportion being offered, quality of management, and technical competence of ARCs. Lenders should be in a position to convert these (qualitative) parameters into cash equivalents for deciding the winning bid. For the purpose of ensuring transparency and uniformity of processes in the sale of stressed assets, a separate online platform may be created, utilizing infrastructure created by SLMA. Banks should determine the reserve price in a realistic manner, and commercial considerations should take precedence in such determination.

Allowing ARCs to purchase financial assets from a broader range of entities would give impetus to debt aggregation, which is a necessity for the efficient resolution of stressed assets.

    "output": "The Reserve Bank may consider permitting ARCs to acquire financial assets from all regulated entities, including AIFs, FPIs, AMCs making investments on behalf of MFs, all NBFCs (including HFCs) irrespective of asset size, and from retail investors. ARCs can also acquire debt from other ARCs under extant regulations, subject to some conditions, including the utilization of sale proceeds for redemption of underlying SRs. However, aggregation of debt by an ARC from other ARCs need not always result in redemption of SRs. For example, multiple ARCs may have acquired portions of distressed debt pertaining to a single borrower, leading to multiple trusts managed by multiple ARC trustees, holding portions of the debt for the benefit of multiple and distinct classes of SR investors. In this case, it may be advantageous to bring these fragmented portions of the debt of the common borrower under the management of a common trustee ARC, where only the trusteeship and management of the trust assets would change hands from one ARC to another, with any purchase consideration for this transfer necessarily being in cash. Such transactions between ARCs should require approval by a specified majority, by value, of the SR investors concerned or such other prescribed threshold as may be defined by the subscription agreement/trust deed. In these scenarios, the selling ARC should not be required to redeem the associated SRs, and the acquiring ARC should be required to have 'skin in the game' by investing in the associated SRs to the extent of the prescribed minimum threshold. Permitting the existing SR holders to continue holding their SRs may give them the benefit of an upside, the likelihood of which increases with debt consolidation. The regulations should permit a change in the SR trustee/asset management role from one ARC to another, without necessarily extinguishing the SRs."

    "output": "According to section 9(1) of the SARFAESI Act, ARCs can deploy measures of asset reconstruction under the guidelines issued by RBI. Data indicates that approximately 80% of the recovery for the sector has come through methods that do not necessarily lead to business revival. ARCs have rarely used change or takeover of the management of business of the borrowers or conversion of borrowers\u2019 debt into equity as measures for reconstruction. Rescheduling of payment of debts was also involved in only 19.9% of the recovery made by ARCs. This trend has been consistent over the life of the sector. The only change in this trend is use of IBC as a resolution mechanism after it became available. ARCs get the power to use IBC through IBC, 2016 and not through the Act. Assets bought after FY14 are increasingly being resolved through IBC. However, use of IBC by ARCs may not be indicative of a preference for IBC since ARCs\u2019 participation in IBC may be involuntary, with the initiative being taken by primary lenders."

    "input": "Question: What factors determine the methods of asset reconstruction that Asset Reconstruction Companies (ARCs) can gainfully deploy, and what limitations do ARCs face in funding borrowers?",
    "output": "ARCs' ability to fund the borrower, regulatory limitations, and their skill sets determine the methods of asset reconstruction that ARCs can gainfully deploy. Limitations of the restructuring options usually force the ARCs either to take up the measures of recovery only or focus on such assets which do not require major resolution. In general, turnaround of stressed borrowers requires additional funding, requiring different sources of funding and various debt and equity instruments, including but not limited to share capital, priority debt, mezzanine debt, senior debentures, etc., to continue to run the operations efficiently. For a stressed borrower, raising such funds becomes difficult. Almost all stressed borrowers require additional working capital facilities, which are not available from the regular banking system due to adverse asset classification of such accounts. Therefore, for turning around companies, ARCs should be able to timely and sufficiently fund them. Today, there are many limitations for ARCs for funding such requirements. They are not able to provide interim finance in insolvency resolution processes or significantly contribute to a turnaround due to their inability to provide meaningful last mile funding. For undertaking any restructuring of such debt acquired by them, ARCs also have additional restrictions, which limit the extent of restructuring support finance which they can provide. Currently, this is capped at 25% of the funds raised by them under the scheme and should be disclosed upfront in the scheme."

    "output": "Allowing ARCs to sponsor a SEBI registered AIF offers several benefits for reconstructing debt and turning around borrowers, including HNIs.  It provides increased flexibility in restructuring options, as investments into debt or equity can be funded directly from the AIF. Using the AIF as a source helps ARCs raise funds in a risk-mitigated manner based on their performance track record, aiding in turning around many stuck cases. The objective is to use the AIF as an additional vehicle to advance the purpose of the ARCs to facilitate restructuring/ recovery of the acquired debt. For revival of stressed companies, the ARCs may need flexibility to arrange the financial assistance from banks and FIs and additional capital for revival.\n\nGiven the limitation of traditional sources of financing for ARCs, the Committee recommends that, going forward, ARCs should be allowed to sponsor an AIF, duly registered with SEBI with the objective of investing in stressed assets could address the above constraints and provide an additional investor base. Allowing an ARC to sponsor a SEBI registered AIF is proposed as a way forward, to be used as an additional vehicle for facilitating restructuring / recovery of the debt acquired by the ARC and a meaningful turnaround of the borrower. The enabling power under Section 10(2) of the Act may be utilised for this purpose."

    "output": "The committee recommends several measures to improve debt aggregation and the resolution of stressed assets. First, it suggests reducing the threshold for lenders' agreement on an ARC offer from 75% to 66%, aligning with the IBC majority voting threshold. A 60-day timeline for remaining lenders to comply with the majority decision should also be prescribed, with a mandate for 100% provisioning on the loan if a lender fails to comply. The committee also recommends that the planning period for formulating a resolution plan be extended from six months to one year to allow for preconditions for effective planning to be satisfied. For individual ARC exposures above a threshold of Rs.500 crore, a resolution plan that involves any restructuring of debt must satisfy a viability assessment analogous to that prescribed under the Prudential Framework for Resolution of Stressed Assets, i.e. an independent credit evaluation (ICE) by an authorised CRA with a credit opinion of RP4 or better for the residual debt. Furthermore, in cases where an ARC has acquired 66% of aggregate debt pertaining to a borrower, the Act should provide for a two-year moratorium on proceedings against the borrower by other authorities, and Government dues will be deferred in such cases."

The Act should also provide that Government dues including revenues, taxes, cesses and rates due to the Central Government, State Government or local authority will be deferred in such cases.\nFor better value realization for selling lenders and enhancing the effectiveness of ARCs in asset reconstruction, both debt and equity pertaining to a borrower may be allowed to be sold by lenders to ARCs with suitable checks and balances."

    "output": "ARCs, while allowed to resolve financial assets through the IBC process as secured creditors, are not currently permitted to act as Resolution Applicants (RA) under IBC because their legal and regulatory design is focused on debt recovery rather than insolvency resolution. To enhance ARCs' ability to resolve stressed assets, they may be allowed to participate in IBC as a Resolution Applicant either through their SR trust or through the AIF sponsored by them. To ensure they focus on financial asset reconstruction, a principal business requirement (PBR) should be applicable, stating that the AUM (Assets Under Management) by the ARC acquired through AIF and IBC should not together exceed the AUM acquired via SR issuance at any time."

However, RBI guidelines indicate that no ARC shall take this measure, until the RBI issues necessary guidelines in this behalf, which has not yet occurred. It is recommended that suitable guidelines to operationalize Section 9(1)(b) of the Act be issued by RBI.\n\nSection 13 of the Act allows secured creditors to enforce security interest only in respect of assets classified by them as Non-Performing Assets (NPAs). While RBI has issued guidelines on asset classification of stressed assets on the ARCs\u2019 own balance sheets, it has not issued any such guidelines on asset (specifically NPA) classification of assets held in trust structures managed by the ARC, such as the SR trusts or any other structure managed by the ARC. It is recommended that RBI consider issuing guidelines under Section 2(1)(o)(b) of the Act for \u2018standard\u2019 / NPA classification of assets managed by ARCs but not on their balance sheets. Since the classification is required only for the purpose of enforcement of security interest, it would suffice to distinguish between \u2018standard\u2019 assets and NPAs, without requiring sub-classification of NPAs or provisioning."

    "input": "Question: Why is a vibrant secondary market for Security Receipts (SRs) essential, and what factors have hindered its development?",
    "output": "A vibrant secondary market for SRs is essential for several reasons:\n\n*   It is a prerequisite for providing an easy exit to Qualified Buyers (QBs) and to thereby attract more investors.\n*   Increased investor participation may also facilitate better price discovery in the stressed assets market.\n*   All this may, in turn, motivate lenders to sell stressed assets at an earlier stage and ARCs to attempt faster resolution.\n\nSEBI has issued listing guidelines for the SRs vide Securities and Exchange Board of India (Public Offer and Listing of Securitised Debt Instruments) (Amendment) Regulations, 2018 dated June 26, 2018. However, despite the availability of the listing framework, listing and consequent trading of SRs through the exchanges has not taken off. For all practical purposes, there is no secondary market for SRs.\n\nData shows that the majority of the outstanding SRs are either being held by selling lenders as sale consideration or by the ARCs themselves due to regulatory requirement. Overall 65.7% of total SRs were held by selling lenders, followed by 19.9% by ARCs and only 14.4% of total SRs were held by other QBs.\nOne of the reasons behind lack of trading in SRs is the nature of the SR itself. There is no definitive obligation on the part of ARCs as trustees to redeem the SRs issued. ARCs are only obligated to distribute whatever is recovered from the underlying debt. However, SRs do provide a possibility of high return through upside if ARCs can make recovery above the nominal value of SRs issued."

    "input": "Question: What factors contribute to the limited uptake of Security Receipts (SRs) and what recommendations have been made to improve the secondary market for SRs?",
    "output": "The limited uptake of Security Receipts (SRs) is due to factors such as the low upside provided by Asset Reconstruction Companies (ARCs) and the lack of a definitive obligation to redeem the SRs. The overall upside achieved by ARCs stood at 4.44% of the total SRs issued for the period FY04-FY21, and even the redemption of SRs has not been very encouraging. To strengthen the ARCs\u2019 ability to resolve the underlying stressed assets and facilitate greater redemption and upside, various measures have been recommended, including realistic price discovery. It is expected that these recommendations will allow ARCs to generate attractive returns for SR investors and thereby help bring vibrancy in the secondary market for SRs.\n\nData shows a significant change in trend. During the period FY04-FY13 upside income was equally distributed among ARCs and other Qualifying Buyers (QBs). However, during FY14-FY21 overall 73.4% of upside seems to have gone to other QBs. This change can be explained by increased participation by varied classes of QBs. The Committee believes that broad basing the QBs may act as a catalyst for stimulating the secondary market for SRs. Therefore, to increase the investor base of SRs, the Committee recommends that the list of eligible QBs may be further expanded to include High Net Worth Individuals (HNIs) with minimum investment of Rs.1 crore, corporates (net worth-Rs.10 crore & above), Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) even if not notified as Financial Institutions (FIs), trusts, family offices, pension funds, distressed asset funds with the condition that defaulting promoters should not be gaining access to secured assets through SRs."

Additionally, to leverage the existing capital of ARCs and enable more investor participation, the Committee recommends amendments to current regulations, including reducing the minimum contribution by an ARC to 2.5% of total SRs issued in each class and scheme for transactions on a 100% cash basis and reducing the minimum contribution to 15% of the SRs subscribed by lenders (subject to a minimum of 2.5% of total SRs issued, in each class/scheme) for transactions where lenders subscribe to SRs."

Further, if an ARC ceases to be a manager/ trustee of an ARC scheme (e.g. as envisaged in para. D.1.16. ibid), it should be permitted to divest its entire investment in SRs of that scheme if it so desires. However, the extant regulations (para 5, proviso (iii) of the SC/RC Guidelines/Directions, 2003) stipulate that an ARC shall continue to hold the amount invested in SRs invested in SRs under each scheme until the redemption of all SRs issued under the scheme."

The minimum investment in SRs under any scheme needs to be held by the ARC only as long as it is a manager/trustee of the underlying assets in any scheme.\n\nFor all transactions, the minimum investment in SRs by an ARC, per SR class/scheme, should be 15% of the lenders\u2019 investment in SRs or 2.5% of the total SRs issued, per SR class/scheme, whichever is higher. Any investment in excess of the required minimum may be divested at any time. According to illustrative examples, if the total value of SRs issued is Rs.100 and investment in SRs by selling bank/FI is Rs.40, ARC's investment in SRs is Rs. 6, which is higher of 15% of Rs. 40 (Rs.6) and 2.5% of Rs.100 (Rs.2.50).

The RBI notifications dated May 16, 2018, and March 10, 2021, designate all categories of AIFs set up as trusts as QBs, but they also impose conditions, such as prohibiting AIFs invested in an ARC from investing in SRs issued by that ARC. FPIs, comparatively, face no such condition. Additionally, 100% FDI is allowed into the ARC sector through the automatic route. These differences result in a non-level playing field between AIFs and FPIs, where global players owning and controlling an ARC via FDI can invest through their FPIs in SRs issued by those ARCs, while AIFs set up as trusts are prohibited from doing so. The recommendation is that the RBI should amend the participating conditions governing AIF and FPI investment in SRs to establish a level playing field."

Shareholders\u2019 equity provides protection against losses and makes a company less reliant on external funding. An appropriate level of shareholders\u2019 equity also determines a company\u2019s ability to expand its business activities. ARC regulations prescribe a minimum NOF of Rs.100 crore for registration as an ARC, and ARCs are required to meet this criterion on an ongoing basis. Beyond this minimum prescription of NOF, it is desirable that ARCs have a higher level of NOF to meet the requirement of the capital-intensive nature of ARC business. Data as of March 31, 2021, shows clustering of ARCs wherein approximately 75% of the registered ARCs have an NOF level between Rs.100-200 crore, 11% have their NOF level above Rs.1500 crore, and the rest of the ARCs have an NOF level between Rs.200-400 crore.

SEBI amended the ICDR Regulations, 2018 and SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations, 2011 in March 2019 to incorporate changes as RBI had withdrawn its previous debt restructuring schemes such as CDR, SDR, S4A, etc. After the amendment, SEBI defined \u201clenders\u201d under Regulation 158(6) of SEBI ICDR Regulations and Regulation 10(1)(i) of SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations, 2011 as all SCBs (excluding RRBs) and AIFIs. Considering that ARCs, as pledgees of shares offered as security, may require the above dispensations for their debt restructuring activities, the Committee recommends that SEBI may (a) extend the exemption from open offer requirements, for invocation of pledge, to ARCs as well, in line with the exemption enjoyed by SCBs and public financial institutions under Regulation 10(1) of SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations, 2011 and (b) also modify the explanation of \u2018lenders\u2019 in Regulation 158(6) of SEBI ICDR Regulations and Regulation 10(1)(i) of SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations, 2011 to include ARCs."

    "output": "Various stakeholders have suggested changes or more clarity in the extant taxation provisions with respect to investment in the SRs issued by the ARCs. One of the matters pertains to the pass-through regime for AIF income from investment in SRs. AIFs as QBs invest in the security receipts issued by ARC trusts. Under the income-tax law, the ARC trusts enjoy a complete pass-through status and the income is taxable in the hands of the investors based on the characterization that is determined by the ARC trust. Typically, the ARC trust characterizes the income as \u2018business income\u2019. The AIF loses its otherwise tax transparent status if it earns a business income and such income is taxed at the AIF level at the maximum marginal rate, i.e., at an effective tax rate 42.74%. The Committee proposes that all income from investment in SRs issued by ARC trusts earned by an AIF should also be considered as pass through and taxable in the hands of the investors of the AIF. The possibility of a 42.74% tax at the AIF level is a deterrent for this investment to flow into ARC trusts. Large pools of capital are required for large resolutions by ARCs. Hence a pass-through regime for AIF income from investment in SRs issued by an ARC Trust is critical to the success of a competitive market for these NPAs and for maximization of recovery for the ARC.\n\nThe other matter pertains to clarity on the tax rate applicable to FPIs when they invest in the SRs issued by ARC trusts. Under the income-tax law, no specific tax rate is mentioned for taxability of interest income or upside received by FPIs from their investment in the SRs. Presently, a concessional tax regime of 5% exists for taxability of income arising to FPIs and other non-residents (on Government securities, corporate bonds, ECB, etc.), subject to satisfaction of certain conditions. A similar tax treatment may be provided for interest income earned by FPIs from investment in SRs. Also, it may be clarified that any upside arising as business income may be taxed at the rate of 20% (as it is in the nature of income in respect of securities under Section 115AD of Income Tax Act ). Given the risky nature of the investment in SRs as also the fact that significant foreign money is needed to resolve the NPAs in the Indian financial sector, it is essential that tax certainty is provided to foreign investors. The proposed changes will incentivize flow of FPI investment in SRs and help in resolution of bad loans."

    "output": "To address the incentive to peg each member\u2019s shareholding below 20%, the identification of at least one sponsor may be made mandatory. In the interest of efficient recovery of debt by creditors, the Act may be amended to ensure that enforcement rights under Section 13 of the Act would be available to an ARC to which a secured financial asset is assigned, irrespective of the availability of enforcement rights with the assignor under Section 13 of the Act. For this purpose, the definition of \u201csecured creditor\u201d under Act may be modified by amending the closing clause in Section 2(1)(zd)(vi) as follows : \u201cin whose favour security interest is created by any borrower for due repayment of any financial assistance or transferred pursuant to assignment, transfer, transmission, etc. of any financial assistance.\u201d For the purpose of bringing clarity to the meaning of security being a \u201csubstantial part of business\u201d and thereby making the takeover of management practically achievable, an explanation under Section 13(4)(b) of Act may be added. One possible manner it can be explained is as follows: Security for the purpose of this sub-Section can be evaluated to be a \u201csubstantial part of business\u201d if such security was responsible for generation of at least 20% revenue of the business in the preceding financial year or the current market value of such security as determined by an external valuer is more than the 50% of total assets of the borrower as per the latest audited balance sheet. Considering the difficulty faced by ARCs in modification of charge due to reasons mentioned above, GoI may consider carving out a mechanism for automatic transfer of charge without borrower\u2019s consent when a lender sells assets to an ARC. The Committee recommends that SEBI may extend the exemption from open offer requirements, for invocation of pledge, to ARCs in line with by SCBs or public financial institutions under Regulation 10(1) of SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations, 2011.

    "output": "The principles for designing a \u2018True Value Market for NPA\u2019 are as follows: The paragraphs lay down the principles for designing a \u2018True Value Market for NPA\u2019 and make two propositions for it.  \n1. Defining true value market: At the time of NPA sale, both the bank and the ARC estimate the present value of future income streams against the NPA based on financial analysis and scenario building. The outcomes of these exercises are the \u2018true value estimates\u2019 as per the bank and the ARC. It is assumed that the ARC\u2019s estimate incorporates a reconstruction premium over the bank\u2019s estimate, and therefore is greater than the bank\u2019s estimate. A \u2018true value market\u2019 is one where the deal value lies in between the estimate of true value by the bank and the estimate of true value by the ARC. The aim of market design has two objectives: a. incentivize true value deals and b. facilitate sufficient risk transfer out of the banking sector through high levels of investment by non -bank entities. In incentivising true value deals, one is especially concerned about avoiding the inflation of acquisition costs over true value. (The under-pricing of NPAs would be prevented by appropriate setting of the reserve price by the bank, and by competition in the course of the NPA auction). While aiming to achieve its twin objectives, the design must keep in mind the necessity of ensuring both parties must perceive gains to trade from the transaction.  \n2. Design Approach: The cash proportion of the deal and the deal value are the two most important variables determining the attractiveness of the deal for the bank and the ARC. Hence the design approach is to find combinations of cash proportion and deal value that would incentivize both the bank and the ARC to transact. These are referred to as \u2018feasible\u2019 cash proportions and deal values and aim to nudge the market toward those feasible cash proportions and deal values that are consistent with true value transactions and sufficient transfer of risk out of the banking sector."

    "output": "The transaction level economics of the ARC and the role of the bank's investment in securities are analyzed to derive combinations of cash proportion and deal value that incentivize the ARC to transact. This highlights the critical role of the bank's investment in Security Receipts (SRs) in facilitating true value deals, but also shows that this investment must be capped to avoid deal inflation. The analysis also presents the transaction level economics of the bank to derive combinations of cash proportion and deal value that incentivize the bank to transact, highlighting that current prudential norms regarding provisioning for SRs held by the lender are unjustified in the case of true value deals and can render the NPA market infeasible if they persist. We assume that the ARC makes estimates of the return on investment in the transaction and goes for the deal if the return is greater than the weighted cost of capital. The return on investment is the sum of the return on SRs held by the ARC, and the return on the management fee earned from the bank and the investor. Other things being equal, the ARC\u2019s return is inversely proportional to the deal value."

Hence the return on investment in SRs is independent of the cash proportion."

    "input": "Question: How does the ARC's return on investment relate to the cash proportion in a transaction, according to the provided analysis?",
    "output": "The ARC's return is inversely proportional to the proportion of investment in SRs (securities receipts). The management fees collected from the investor is independent of the ARC\u2019s cash proportion, while the investment is directly proportional to the cash proportion. Hence the return on management fees collected from the investor is inversely proportional to the cash proportion. The management fees collected from the bank decreases as the ARC\u2019s cash proportion increases (and the proportion of SRs held by the bank decreases). Since the investment is directly proportional to the cash proportion, the return on management fees collected from the bank consists of a numerator that is inversely proportional and a denominator that is directly proportional to the cash proportion. Hence the return on management fees is inversely proportional to the cash proportion. In sum, the ARC\u2019s return consists of a set of additive terms that are either independent or inversely proportional to the cash proportion. The example in Table 2 illustrates this, assuming that the increase in cash proportion of the ARC is accompanied by a constant cash proportion of the External Investor and a declining cash proportion of the Bank."

    "output": "The ARC\u2019s return increases with the unit fees and the reconstruction premium generated by the ARC, and decreases with the cost of capital. The increase in fees increases the return on the management of securities. An increase in the reconstruction premium increases the redemption proceeds of securities, thus increasing the return on securities held by the ARC.\n\nFor any cash proportion it is possible to compute a threshold deal value above which the ARC would not want to transact. The threshold deal value decreases with an increase in the cash proportion. When the ARC\u2019s cash proportion is 100%, the ARC would not want to transact at a deal value higher than its estimate of the \u2018true value\u2019 of the security discounted by its cost of capital. When the cash proportion of the deal is zero, the ARC would be willing to transact at deal values much higher than the true value\u2019 of the security, or even the book value."

    "instruction": "Answer the question based on the provided context from the financial report.",
    "input": "Question: How does increasing the cash proportion affect the threshold deal value, and what example illustrates this relationship?",
    "output": "Increasing the cash proportion leads to a reduction in the ARC's return, necessitating a decrease in the deal value to restore the ARC's incentives. This means the threshold value would need to come down.  The following example illustrates this with Table 3, presenting two scenarios: one with a low cash proportion and another with a high cash proportion.  In the low cash proportion scenario, the threshold deal value is Rs.46.55 with a 15% ARC cash proportion, a 36% external investor cash proportion and 49% bank investment.  In the high cash proportion scenario, the threshold deal value decreases to Rs.42.65 with a 20% ARC cash proportion, a 36% external investor cash proportion and 44% bank investment. Other values such as ARC investment, external investor investment, bank investment, ARC's estimate of true value, bank's estimate of true value, NPV of management fees paid by the bank and external investor, and total return to ARC are also provided for both scenarios.  The ARC return on investment remains at 20% for both."

    "output": "When the cash proportion is 100%, and the true value estimate of the ARC is Rs.35 and the cost of capital is 20%, then the highest deal value the ARC is able to afford in a 100% cash deal is Rs.35 divided by 1.2, which equals Rs.29.1. When the cash proportion of the deal is zero, the return of the ARC (which is exclusively based on management fees) is infinite. This follows from the fact that the ARC\u2019s investment is zero. Hence the ARC is able to transact at deal values much higher than the true value, or even the book value of the security. As cash proportion is reduced from 100% to zero, the threshold deal value at which the ARC is willing to transact increases from the true value discounted by cost of capital to a value even larger than the book value.\nFact 4 implies Proposition 1.\nProposition 1 : In between cash proportion of 0% and 100%, there exists a cash proportion at which the ARC\u2019s threshold deal value is equal to its true value. If the cash proportion goes above this threshold, which we call the ARC\u2019s true value threshold, the ARC would be unwilling to transact at its true value.\nProposition 1 implies that a deal takes place at an inflated value only if the cash proportion is less than the ARC\u2019s true value threshold. In Scenario 2 of Table 3 from the previous context, an ARC investment of 20% is accompanied by a cash threshold of Rs.42.65. A cash proportion of 26% would yield a threshold deal value that is equal to the ARC\u2019s true value of Rs.40, i.e. a return of 20% with a deal value of Rs.40. Hence 26% is ARC\u2019s true value threshold in this case.\nBy Fact 3, if we start at a cash proportion such that the threshold deal value is equal to the ARC\u2019s true value, and if management fees increases or the cost of capital decreases, the ARC\u2019s return would increase. Thus, the ARC would be willing and able to offer a higher cash proportion at the same true value. Thus, the ARC\u2019s true value threshold increases with an increase in the unit fees and decreases with an increase in the cost of capital. As the reconstruction premium generated by the ARC -investor combine increases, the estimate of true value of the ARC increases. By Proposition 1, the ARC\u2019s true value threshold would decrease."

    "input": "Question: What are the incentives of the investor, and how do they compare to those of the ARC?",
    "output": "Proposition 1 indicates the limits of the investment an ARC is able to make when the deal value is close to its true value. One might assume that the external investor could supply the remaining investment in the SRs, allowing the bank to be paid entirely in cash. However, one has to analyze the incentives of the investor to examine whether this hypothesis is robust. The incentives of the investor are similar to the incentives of the ARC: both obtain returns from their investment in SRs. However, there is a crucial difference: the ARC receives management fees on the SRs held by the bank and by the investor, while the investor pays management fees to the ARC. Assuming the investor and the ARC bear the same cost of capital, the investment incentives of the investor are less attractive than the incentives of the ARC. This implies that if the ARC is unwilling to transact at a certain deal value and cash proportion, then the investor would also be unwilling to transact at that deal value and cash proportion. Further, the realization of redemptions from the SRs, and the management fee payable to the ARC are directly proportional to the proportion of SRs held by the investor, as is the investment. Hence, the return on investment of the investor is independent of the proportion of SRs held by the investor."

    "input": "Question: What conclusions can be drawn regarding investor incentives and the ARC's willingness to transact at certain deal values, and how does this affect the possibility of all-cash deals?",
    "output": "Based on the facts that (i) the incentives of the investor are less attractive than the incentives of the ARC, as the ARC receives management fees on SRs held by both the bank and the investor while the investor pays management fees to the ARC, and (ii) the return on investment of the investor is independent of the proportion of SRs held by the investor, it leads to the conclusion that if the ARC is unwilling to transact at a certain deal value and cash proportion, then the investor would be unwilling to transact at that deal value at any cash proportion.\n\nFrom this, it is concluded that if the ARC is unwilling to transact at its true value above the ARC\u2019s true value threshold, the investor would also be unwilling to invest at that value. Thus, the hypothesis that the investor could make up the shortfall of investment in SRs, thereby allowing the bank to enjoy an all-cash deal, is negated. This implies a deal at the ARC\u2019s true value requires investment in SRs by the bank.\n\nThese conclusions are based on the assumption that the cost of capital of the ARC and the investor are the same. While international investors are able to raise money at low rates of interest, there is also a risk premium associated with India that equalizes the cost of capital.\n\nThe current inflow of foreign capital for all-cash deals seems to possibly be transient as it is focused on the prime NPAs on offer and could reflect speculative inflows of capital. Hence, we cannot rely on the current market design that incentivizes all-cash deals funded by foreign investors for long-term solutions of the NPA problem."

    "input": "Question: Under what conditions is the ARC willing to do a 100% cash deal at the bank's true value, and what factors influence the Bank's true value threshold?",
    "output": "According to Fact 4, the ARC is willing to do a 100% cash deal at the bank\u2019s true value if the ARC\u2019s estimate of \u2018true value\u2019 of the security discounted by the cost of capital is greater than the bank\u2019s estimate of true value. For example, if the ARC\u2019s estimate of \u2018true value\u2019 is Rs.40 and the cost of capital is 20%, then the ARC\u2019s estimate of \u2018true value\u2019 of the security discounted by the cost of capital is Rs. 33.33, which is greater than the bank\u2019s estimate of \u2018true value\u2019 of Rs.28. Conversely, if the ARC\u2019s estimate of \u2018true value\u2019 of the security discounted by the cost of capital is lower than the bank\u2019s estimate of true value, then the ARC is not willing to do a 100% cash deal at the bank\u2019s true value. For instance, if the ARC\u2019s estimate of \u2018true value\u2019 is Rs.32 and the cost of capital is 20%, then the ARC\u2019s estimate of \u2018true value\u2019 of the security discounted by the cost of capital is Rs. 26.66, which is lower than the bank\u2019s estimate of \u2018true value\u2019 Rs. 28. The Bank\u2019s true value threshold increases with an increase in the unit fees and decreases with an increase in the cost of capital. As the reconstruction premium generated by the ARC-investor combine increases, the return of the ARC from the holding of SRs increases. Thus, the ARC earns returns greater than the cost of capital, leading to an increase in the Bank\u2019s true value threshold."

    "input": "Question: What conditions are necessary for the deal value to range between the true value of the bank and the ARC, and why is the lender's investment in SRs useful?",
    "output": "For the deal value to range between the true value of the bank and the ARC, the market needs to converge to a cash proportion between the ARC\u2019s true value threshold and the Bank\u2019s true value threshold. With the present value of management fees at 10%, the cost of capital at 20%, and ARC reconstruction premium at 14%, based on the simple model described above, the ARC\u2019s true value threshold and the Bank\u2019s true value threshold are 30.4% and 62.5% respectively.\nThus, when the reconstruction premium is less than the cost of capital, the bank\u2019s investment in SRs is necessary to achieve deal values that align with the true value of the bank, and an even higher investment by the bank is needed to achieve deal values that align with the true value of the ARC. \nBesides making true value deals possible, there are other reasons why the lender\u2019s investment in SRs is useful: 1. Securitisation reduce the investment of the ARC and thereby limits reduction in overall surplus caused by the high cost of capital of the ARC relative to the bank. 2. It signals the Bank\u2019s continued interest in the underlying NPA, thereby mitigating the possibility that the bank\u2019s information advantage would result in a market for lemons. 3. It allows the bank to partake of the upside from the ARC's reconstruction activities by avoiding the impact of bidders bidding less than true value in NPA auctions (a common phenomenon referred to as \u2018bid shading\u2019)."

    "input": "Question: How is the total return of the bank from a transaction with the ARC calculated, and what factors influence the bank's decision to transact?",
    "output": "The total return of the bank from a transaction with the ARC is calculated as the sum of the cash received and the true value of security receipts (SRs) held, minus the management fees paid on the true value of the SRs. For example, with a 40% cash proportion and a deal value of Rs. 40, the bank receives Rs. 16 in cash, and the face value of security receipts received is Rs. 24. If the true value of the NPA for the bank is Rs. 35, the true value of the SR for the bank is Rs. 21. Management fees to the ARC are paid on the true value of the SRs held by the bank. If the unit fee is 10%, then the total fee to be paid is 10% of the true value, i.e., 10% of Rs. 21 = Rs. 2.1. The total return of the bank from a transaction with the ARC is Rs. 16 (cash) + Rs. 21 (SRs) \u2013 Rs. 2.1 (fees) = Rs. 34.9. The bank\u2019s decision on whether to transact or not is based on whether the return of the bank from a transaction with the ARC is greater than the true value, Rs. 35. The bank would prefer not to transact with the ARC and opt for internal restructuring. The only element of the Bank\u2019s return that depends on deal value is the upfront cash payment. For any given cash proportion, this upfront payment increases with the deal value. Therefore, other things being equal, the Bank\u2019s return is proportional to the deal value. This depends on the assumption that the management fees payable by the bank is assessed on the bank\u2019s true value rather than on the nominal value of SRs."

    "instruction": "Answer the question based on the provided context from the financial report.",
    "input": "Question: How does the bank's return behave at low cash proportions and what factors influence its preference for securities over cash in such scenarios?",
    "output": "For assessing management fees, the bank\u2019s return function could exhibit anomalous behaviour at low cash proportions because when a deal is mainly transacted in security receipts, the additional management fees payable on those security receipts on account of an increase in the deal value may be greater than the additional cash received. Hence the bank prefers lower deal values. This anomaly disappears when the true value becomes the basis for calculating the payable fees. At deal values significantly lower than the true value, the bank\u2019s value function declines with an increase in the cash proportion. The reason is that the cash component of the deal is proportional to the deal value, but the securities component is proportional to the true value. Hence, when the  deal value is significantly lower than the true value, the bank prefers payment in securities rather than in cash. Of course, a higher securities component also attracts higher management fees. Hence, at low deal values, the bank would prefer securities to cash but only if the unit fee is low enough. This anomaly disappears at deal values close to or higher than the true value, which leads to Fact 6: Other things being equal, at deal values close to or higher than the true value, the Bank\u2019s return increases with the proportion of cash in the deal."

    "output": "Fact 7 states: (i) The threshold deal value decreases with an increase in the cash proportion. (ii) When the cash proportion is 100%, the Bank would not want to transact at a deal value lower than its estimate of the \u2018true value\u2019 of the security (iii) When the cash proportion of the deal is zero, the Bank would be unwilling to transact even at deal values much higher than the true value\u2019 of the security, or even the book value. In other words, the threshold value would come down. (ii) When the cash proportion is 100%, the Bank\u2019s return is exclusively through cash which would need to at least equal to its true value estimate. (iii) When the cash proportion is 100%, the Bank\u2019s return is exclusively through securities. This return would equal the Bank\u2019s true value estimate minus the management fees. Given a strictly positive fee, this can never be greater than the Bank\u2019s true value estimate. Hence a transaction would not happen even at very high deal values.\nProposition 2 states: If the ARC\u2019s estimate of \u2018true value\u2019 of the security discounted by the cost of capital is less than the bank\u2019s estimate of true value, then there is no cash proportion between zero and one, such that the threshold deal value of the bank is lower than the threshold deal value of the ARC. In this scenario, no deal is possible at a 100% cash proportion. Further, when the ARC\u2019s estimate of \u2018true value\u2019 of the security discounted by the cost of capital is less than the bank\u2019s estimate of true value, and when the management fees is linked to the bank\u2019s estimate of true value, (not the deal value), then the ARC is unable to offer a deal value that would be attractive to the bank, no matter what the cash proportion. When the ARC\u2019s estimate of \u2018true value\u2019 of the security discounted by the cost of capital is greater than the bank\u2019s estimate of true value, a transaction is always possible. However, a transaction at the ARC\u2019s true value may not be possible. To make a deal possible, the following measures need to be adopted: 1. Estimating True Value by the bank in a conservative manner, in line with its internal restructuring capabilities. 2. Facilitating a reduced cost of capital for the ARC."

    "output": "Relaxing capital provisioning requirements can facilitate transactions with the ARC, provided the deal does not take place at inflated values and the SRs do not inherit the capital provisioning requirements of the underlying NPA. This would allow the bank to save on capital provisioning, sweetening the transaction. This relaxation is appropriate only if the cash proportion of the deal is high enough to ensure that deal values are not inflated above the true value of the ARC. Considering the need to transfer a sufficient amount of risk out of the banking system, ensure sufficient \u2018skin in the game\u2019 for non-bank investors, and complementary measures, the relaxation of provisioning requirements should kick in at 51%.

    "output": "India\u2019s external sector has shown remarkable progress in the last three decades after the economic liberalisation reforms were set in motion. Over the years, linkages of the Indian economy with the rest of the world in terms of trade and capital flows have increased. In the last decade, India\u2019s foreign exchange reserves have grown from USD 290.5 billion in August 2012 to USD 560.4 billion in August 2022. During this decadal period, India\u2019s Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) has increased from USD 46.6 billion to USD 84.8 billion; imports have increased from USD 489.3 billion to USD 612.6 billion, and exports have grown from USD 306.0 billion to USD 421.9 billion. Meanwhile, the international monetary and financial system has moved towards being multipolar as reflected in the steadily decreasing share of USD in foreign exchange reserves of countries, the increasing usage of other currencies in trade invoicing and settlement, and the emergence of various bilateral and regional economic cooperation agreements. This, along with recent geopolitical developments, has set the stage for the emergence of various other currencies, including the INR, as prospective currencies for use in international transactions.\n\nAgainst this backdrop and in accordance with the Terms of Reference, the Inter -Departmental Group (IDG) examined the prospects of internationalisation of INR and has recommended a roadmap to achieve the same. The IDG deliberated on all the issues related to internationalisation of INR in a granular manner and recommends a set of time bound steps, which would accelerate the pace of internationalisation. The IDG notes that some of these steps have already been initiated and are currently work in progress. The Group would also like to emphasize that the timeframe for the implementation of the various recommendations has been suggested keeping in view the institutional capacity, preparedness and priority of macro-economic supporting conditions. \n\nThe report discusses the concept of internationalisation of a currency. The IDG views internationalisation as a continuous process involving progressive capital account convertibility, wherein, the domestic currency increasingly acquires the character of a de facto freely convertible currency for international financial transactions. The size of an economy combined with the scale of external trade has a direct bearing on internationalisation of its currency. The IDG feels that INR has the potential to become an internationalised currency as India is one of the fastest growing countries and has shown remarkable resilience even in the face of major headwinds. Further, India has made appreciable progress in terms of capital account convertibility, global value chain integration, setting up of GIFT city, etc. The higher usage of INR in invoicing and settlement of international trade, as well as in capital account transactions, will give INR a progressively international presence. Various aspects related to the process as well as underlying factors impacting the pace of internationalisation of a currency have also been elucidated in this chapter. \n\nThe IDG reviewed the rise in prominence of the Chinese Yuan as an international currency (CNY as part of the IMF, SDR basket, composition of CNY in the foreign exchange reserves of various nations, etc.), in spite of China retaining capital controls in many areas. China\u2019s export -oriented manufacturing sector provides the basis for internationalisation of the Renminbi and this is supplemented by arrangements with partner countries."

Over the short term, the IDG recommends: designing a template and adopting a standardized approach for examining proposals on bilateral and multilateral trade arrangements for invoicing, settlement, and payment in INR and local currencies; making efforts to enable INR as an additional settlement currency in existing multilateral mechanisms such as ACU; facilitating LCS framework for bilateral transactions in local currencies and operationalizing bilateral swap arrangements with the counterpart countries in local currencies; encouraging opening of INR accounts for non-residents (other than nostro accounts of overseas banks) both in India and outside India; integrating Indian payment systems with other countries for cross-border transactions; strengthening financial markets by fostering a global 24x5 INR market and promoting India as the hub for INR transactions and price discovery; facilitating launch of BIS Investment Pools (BISIP) in INR and inclusion of G-Secs in global bond indices; recalibrating the FPI regime and rationalizing/harmonizing the extant Know Your Customer (KYC) guidelines; and providing equitable incentives to exporters for INR trade settlement.\n\nOver the medium-term horizon, the IDG has recommended: a review of taxes on Masala bonds; international use of Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) for cross border trade transactions and inclusion of INR as a direct settlement currency in the Continuous Linked Settlement (CLS) system; examination of taxation issues in financial markets to harmonise tax regimes of India and other financial centres; and allowing banking services in INR outside India through off-shore branches of Indian banks.\n\nFinally, the IDG feels that over the long term, India will achieve higher level of trade linkages with other countries and improved macro-economic parameters, and INR may ascend to a level where it would be widely used and preferred by other economies as a \u201cvehicle currency\u201d. Thus, the IDG recommends that in the long run, efforts should be made for inclusion of INR in IMF\u2019s SDR basket."

    "output": "This chapter provides an overview of the accepted definition of internationalisation of a currency and examines the need and enabling factors required for internationalisation of the INR. We review the available research in this context and explain why further internationalisation of the INR makes economic sense.\n\nAn international currency is used and held beyond the borders of the issuing country for transactions between residents and non-residents, and between residents of two countries other than the issuing country. Currency internationalisation has thus been described as the international extension of a national currency\u2019s basic functions of serving as a unit of account, medium of exchange and store of value. In other words, the internationalization of a currency is an expression of its external credibility as the economy integrates globally."

    "output": "The US dollar has been the dominant global currency for the better part of the last century, supported by the size of the US economy, the reach of its trade and financial networks, the depth and liquidity of US financial markets, and a history of macroeconomic stability and currency convertibility. Dollar dominance has also benefited from the lack of viable alternatives, the incomplete nature of the European monetary union, a shrinking population and uncertain debt dynamics in Japan, and the relative decline of the UK economy. These factors have undermined the Euro, the Japanese Yen, and the British Pound, as viable challengers to the US dollar. Other attractive stores of value, like the Swiss franc, the Canadian dollar, and the Australian dollar, lack the scale to become a dominant global currency. The Chinese Renminbi is an obvious challenger, but its ability to rival the US dollar will depend on future policies in both the US and China and the ability of the Chinese economy and its financial system to demonstrate the same long-term resilience, integrity, transparency, openness, and stability as the US economy."

    "input": "Question: What are the roles of an international currency, and what benefits does currency internationalization provide?",
    "output": "An international currency performs three functions of money \u2013 as a medium of exchange, a unit of account, and a store of value. It does so at two distinct levels, for private and public transactions and resultantly plays six roles in total (Table 1.1). As a medium of exchange, it is used by private actors to settle international economic transactions or by governments as a vehicle for exchange market intervention and balance of payments (BoP) financing. As a store of value, it acts as a reserve currency and at a private level, it is held as capital assets.\n\nThe benefits of currency internationalisation accrue largely to a country\u2019s private sector and are fairly evident. These may be larger for a relatively small economy than for a large one. Firstly, the internationalisation of its currency allows the country\u2019s exporters and importers to limit exchange rate risk. As the internationalisation of a country\u2019s currency broadens and deepens its financial market, domestic firms may be able to invoice and settle their exports/imports in their currency, thus shifting exchange rate risk to their foreign counterparts. Secondly, it permits domestic firms and financial institutions to access international financial markets without assuming exchange rate risk. Thirdly, the internationalisation of its currency offers new profit opportunities to financial institutions, although this benefit may be offset in part by the entry of foreign financial institutions into the domestic financial market (to the extent that the government permits it). Finally, a larger, more efficient financial sector may serve the domestic non-financial sector better by reducing the cost of capital and widening the set of financial institutions that are willing and able to provide capital. This would boost capital formation in the economy thereby increasing growth and reducing unemployment.\n\nCurrency internationalisation may, of course, allow a country\u2019s government to finance part of its budget deficit by issuing domestic currency debt in international markets rather than issuing foreign currency instruments. It may, likewise, allow a government to finance part, if not all, of its current account deficit without drawing down its official reserves. This benefit is not confined exclusively to reserve currency countries such as the United States, whose government debt is one of the principal reserve assets held by foreign central banks and governments. The current account deficit may also be financed by private capital flows from abroad, especially from the banking system, as financing in domestic currency becomes integrated globally. Further, the internationalisation of a currency reduces the requirement for the authorities to maintain and depend on large foreign exchange reserves in convertible currencies (along with its associated costs) to manage external vulnerabilities. Further, at the macroeconomic level, internationalisation of a currency results in lowering the impact of sudden stops and reversals of capital flows and enhances the ability to repay external sovereign debt."

    "instruction": "Answer the question based on the provided context from the financial report.",
    "input": "Question: What are the potential implications and costs associated with the internationalization of a country's currency, and how do they compare to the benefits?",
    "output": "The internationalization of a currency may have implications such as the obligation of a country to supply its currency to meet the global demand, which may conflict with its domestic monetary policies, also known as the Triffin dilemma. Additionally, it may accentuate an external shock, given the open channel of the flow of funds into and out of the country and from one currency to another.\n\nThe costs also arise from the additional demand for money and an increase in the volatility of the demand. International currency use can also have an impact on financing conditions in a way that is sometimes undesired, as seen when former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan mentioned the 'conundrum' of low long-term interest rates due to foreign demand for long-term bonds. To summarize, the main costs of allowing greater international use of the currency emerge from the possible increased volatility in the exchange and money markets, thus making the conduct of monetary policy more complex.\n\nHowever, the benefits of internationalization, such as limited exchange rate risk, lower cost of capital due to better access to international financial markets, high seigniorage benefits, and reduced requirement of foreign exchange reserves, outweigh the concerns. The internationalization of a currency is a long-drawn process involving continuous change and incremental progress, enabling timely redressal of associated concerns and challenges."

    "instruction": "Answer the question based on the provided context from the financial report.",
    "input": "Question: What factors impact the pace of internationalization of a currency, and what prerequisites have been identified for internationalization?",
    "output": "The economic size of a country plays the most vital role in determining the pace of internationalisation. Besides this, the demand -side factors like network effects, invoicing practices and store of value and the supply-side factors such as domestic financial market depth, offshore markets, currency convertibility and capital account liberalisation, together with financial openness also play an important role in influencing the international acceptance of the currency. Mohan, Patra and Kapur (2013) have identified four prerequisites for internationalisation:\n\nThe reserve currency country should have deep and liquid financial and foreign exchange markets, which would facilitate the conduct of foreign exchange policies, manage currency risks effectively and support financial asset transactions denominated in the reserve currency.\n\nCurrency convertibility and a credible commitment to an open capital account to facilitate financial flows with minimal transactions costs; liquidity (narrow bid -offer spreads in normal and stress times); a full yield curve (to be able to manage duration and curve positioning); and depth, offering a range of products across different credit qualities (to achieve the desired level of credit risk).\n\nWide use in private sector transactions: a currency with a large share in world gross domestic product (GDP), trade and finance attracts more users and establishes network externalities. For example, if the country issuing the reserve currency is also a large exporter or importer, it could have the bargaining power to impose the use of its currency and increase acceptance of its currency. Further, such a financially integrated economy typically enhances the breadth and depth of its domestic financial markets.\n\nMacroeconomic and political stability: Policymaking institutions with credibility and a track record of maintaining price stability are critical ingredients to sustaining confidence in the currency\u2019s long -term purchasing power.\n\nInternationalisation gathers pace as a country progresses on the path of fulfilling the above pre-conditions. It is evident from the literature that while internationalisation is a desirable goal for an aspirational economy, it is a decision with several moving parts/imponderables and therefore needs a holistic examination. The Inter -Departmental Group (IDG) has thus started from this premise and attempted an in -depth analysis of all the relevant issues relating to internationalisation of INR."

    "input": "Question: What trends are observed in the use of international currencies, and what factors might accelerate diversification away from the US dollar?",
    "output": "The international monetary system has been evolving over the last few decades in response to major structural shifts in the global economy. The dollar\u2019s reserve currency status has been supported by the sustained leading position of the US in the world order, the use of the US dollar for trade invoicing and cross-border investments across the world, and the preferred choice of currency as an exchange rate anchor. However, there has been a definitive downward trend in the share of the US dollar as part of global foreign exchange reserves, which has declined from about 85 per cent in the 1970s to around 70 per cent in the early 2000s and further down to 58.9 percent in the first quarter of 2022. However, the share of the US dollar continues to be high, especially considering the decline of GDP of USA as a percentage of world GDP from around 40 per cent to 24 per cent over the same period.\nThis declining trend is not just a result of diversification away from the US dollar by most reserve managers, especially towards currencies of China and other smaller open market economies, such as Australia, Canada, and South Korea. The trend also reflects an attempt by some emerging and developing Asian economies to internationalise their currencies to complement their share in global trade and output. Globalisation and the consequent dispersion of global output and power away from the western world have led to a more multipolar global economy.\nThe recent geopolitical developments, especially the Ukraine conflict, that started in February 2022 and the freezing of almost half of Russia\u2019s foreign exchange reserves by western countries and the suspension of its banks from participation in the SWIFT messaging system will likely accelerate this diversification and may lead to an even more multipolar international monetary system. Given the size of the Chinese economy and the degree of its integration with global trade and finance, China has emerged as a natural competitor for the US and the Renminbi holds the potential to gain a bigger share of international foreign exchange reserves globally. It may, however, be a slow process as the Renminbi is not fully convertible on the capital account, and the Chinese financial markets are under-developed and less transparent relative to the US."

    "output": "The Indian Rupee (INR) is accepted to some extent in Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Hong Kong, Sri Lanka, United Arab Emirates (UAE), Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and the United Kingdom (UK), among others, while it is legal tender in Nepal and Bhutan. The Nepal Rastra Bank, Royal Monetary Authority of Bhutan and Bank Negara Malaysia also hold Government of India securities and Treasury Bills. Some sovereigns, like Singapore, hold Indian equity and bond assets (including G-secs) through their sovereign wealth funds.\nVarious measures have been undertaken in recent times to promote the internationalisation of INR. These, inter alia, include:\n(i) allowing issuance of offshore Rupee-denominated \u2018masala\u2019 bonds;\n(ii) allowing domestic banks to freely offer foreign exchange prices to non-residents at all times, out of their Indian books, either by a domestic sales team or through their overseas branches;\n(iii) allowing Rupee derivatives (with settlement in foreign currency) to be traded in International Financial Services Centers (IFSCs); and\n(iv) an additional arrangement for invoicing, payment and settlement of export/import in INR has been enabled vide circular dated July 11, 2022.\nAccording to an IMF Staff Discussion Note on \u2018Internationalisation of Emerging Market Currencies: A Balance between Risks and Rewards\u2019 (October 2011), the Indian Rupee, the Brazilian Real, the Chinese Renminbi, the Russian Ruble and the South African Rand were identified as the key emerging market currencies with the potential for internationalisation. According to the IMF note, all these economies have significant regional importance and economic weight, and despite severe data limitations, there is evidence that the use of these emerging market currencies in international transactions has shown a marked increase in the past few years.\nThese developments have challenged the orthodoxy and have shown that full capital account convertibility may not be a necessary prerequisite for internationalisation.\nLooking ahead, the conditions seem opportune for the emergence of INR as an international currency. It is possible that greater cross-border flows could cause greater variability in domestic macro parameters. It is argued that the bilateral currency swap arrangements may provide a blueprint for reducing the dependence on the US dollar for settling trade transactions. Interestingly, China has followed a similar approach by using a large number of bilateral swaps and Lines of Credit ( LoC) to encourage the use of the Renminbi for international trade transactions. Trade transactions between countries, where there is an underlying swap at the central bank level to take care of liquidity mismatches, would benefit from greater exchange rate stability. This would further propel international trade volumes through higher stakeholder confidence for invoicing and settlement in domestic currencies. However, the way forward for further internationalisation of the INR would involve a series of coordinated public policy steps. Thus, a template or standardised approach must be prepared to engage with the interested central banks for local currency settlement/swaps/LoC. This may emerge as the inflexion point for the process of further internationalisation of INR.\nThis IDG has deliberated on all the above key issues and suggested suitable reform measures and recommendations in this regard."

The Euro, despite being considered an alternative to the US dollar, has not lived up to its full potential due to independent fiscal policies, regional disparities, and concerns raised by the Ukraine conflict and coordinated economic sanctions. The Australian Dollar's transition from an insular currency to an internationalized one took over a decade, starting in 1983, facilitated by a free float, dismantled capital controls, an active local bond market, and a non-deliverable forward currency market, with the floating exchange rate acting as a buffer to external shocks."

    "input": "Question: How did the Australian dollar (AUD) become an internationalized currency, and what role did the global bond market play in this process?",
    "output": "An internationalised currency, like the AUD, serves non-residents as a store of value when they buy or sell deposits or bonds denominated in that currency. For the AUD, this extended beyond non-resident investment in the domestic bond market, as non-resident investors benefited from Australian issuers selling AUD bonds offshore. Large sums were raised by non-resident borrowers issuing AUD bonds in the domestic market (kangaroo bonds) and by non-resident issuers of AUD bonds marketed to offshore investors.\n\nThe development of a derivatives market, particularly a currency swap market, played an important role in the internationalisation of the AUD bond market. Well-developed interest rate swap and currency markets linked the domestic and international markets. Furthermore, a broad tax exemption applicable to offshore issues provided additional support, potentially encouraging resident issuers to issue offshore, despite a withholding tax on coupons paid on domestic bonds.\n\nAustralia has substantial net foreign liabilities denominated in domestic currency, with banks playing a prominent role due to their strong credit ratings, enabling them to borrow from foreigners on attractive terms and act as intermediaries between the domestic economy and international investors. The Australian example demonstrates that a currency can transition from extensive controls restricting its use to domestic residents to an internationalised currency within a few years. This process was facilitated by the removal of restrictions and the development of a vibrant domestic fixed income market with a range of derivatives. The AUD\u2019s internationalisation, supported by the assets\u2019 yield advantage over US dollar assets, suggests that currencies with higher interest rates may internationalise faster than those with relatively lower interest rates. The transition of AUD from an insular currency to an internationalised currency took over a decade, starting in 1983 when the currency was made a free float and capital controls were dismantled. The floating exchange rate acted as a buffer to external shocks, particularly to shifts in terms of trade."

    "output": "In a bid to reduce dependence on the US dollar and assert its influence on international trade and finance, China has been continuously making efforts to increase the international use of its currency. In 2003, China stepped up its efforts towards promoting the internationalisation of the Renminbi by (i) allowing border trade to be denominated and settled in Renminbi, (ii) permitting foreign trade institutions to open settlement accounts in banks in China\u2019s border areas for collections and payments in border trade, and (iii) encouraging banks in China\u2019s border areas to establish corresponding banking relationships with banks in neighbouring countries\u2019 border areas to settle border trade through banks. Seeking to reduce the reliance of importers and exporters on the US dollar, trial use of Renminbi -denominated settlement of trade between five cities (Shanghai, Guandong, Shenzen, Zhuhai and Dongguan - major special economic zones, SEZs) and Hong Kong, Macau and Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries was started in 2009. This was augmented by tax breaks for companies and People\u2019s Bank of China (PBoC) encouraged banks to offer Renminbi settlement services. Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralisation (CMIM) is the regional currency swap agreement between the ASEAN countries and China, Japan and South Korea (ASEAN+3). It was established in 2010 with a total of USD 120 billion in swap lines and expanded in 2014 to USD 240 billion, of which China contributes about USD 77 billion (USD 68 billion, excluding its swap line with Hong Kong). Initially, participating central banks, including the PBoC, agreed to provide US dollars to their CMIM partners in exchange for local currencies. In March 2021, it was then agreed to permit local currency swaps on a voluntary and demand -driven basis. It serves as a channel for Renminbi liquidity for partner countries. The PBoC has bilateral currency exchange agreements with 39 central banks, totalling RMB 3.7 trillion (USD 550 billion). In contrast to Federal Reserve swap lines, however, these are not permanent and unlimited in amount. In each case, the maximum amount that can be borrowed is specified by an agreement with the foreign central bank. Till date, there is only limited evidence of the actual use of Renminbi swap lines. In October 2015, China launched its Cross-border Interbank Payment System (CIPS). CIPS is a messaging and clearing system for international transactions. It allows international banks to clear cross -border RMB transactions with their onshore Chinese counterparts directly, rather than through clearing banks located in offshore centres, which in turn have correspondent relationships with Chinese banks."

    "output": "In 2017, the launch of the Bond Connect program opened an additional channel through which international investors could access the Chinese market with enhanced operational efficiency, especially regarding account opening and trade settlement. These efforts led Chinese stocks and bonds to be added to benchmark indices, such as Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI), Financial Times Stock Exchange (FTSE) Russell World Government Bond Index, Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Index and JP Morgan Government bond index-Emerging markets.\nThe first multilateral free trade agreement through Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), recently ratified in January 2022, forms a new trading bloc comprising of China and fourteen nations, which include the ASEAN countries, as well as Japan, Australia, and New Zealand. China is one of the nations that will benefit the most from the RCEP because there will be increased access to their goods across the region, giving them a chance to gain more investment support. China is already the largest trading partner of ASEAN, and this agreement can further strengthen its position.\nDigital Yuan \u2013 China is one of the leaders in Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) research and execution. The digital Yuan may not be an international currency yet, but it is certainly gaining momentum in China. Domestic usage of the digital Yuan could have a spillover effect on several international currencies as China is the second largest economy in the world and also has the world\u2019s largest share in global trade. The digital Yuan will allow China to issue more debt in the Renminbi and strengthen networks and mechanisms for debt repayment.\nIn May 2022, the International Monetary Fund, in the latest valuation review of the Special Drawing Right (SDR) raised Renminbi\u2019s weight in the basket of currencies that make up the SDR by 1.36 percentage points to 12.28 per cent. With this, the Renminbi now accounts for the third-largest share in the SDR basket.\nIn June 2022, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) announced a Renminbi Liquidity Arrangement (RMBLA) developed with the PBoC to provide liquidity to central banks through a new reserve pooli ng scheme. The reserve pooling provides additional features as participating central banks would not only be able to draw down on their contributions but would also gain access to additional funding through a collateralised liquidity window operated by BIS, up to an amount equivalent to the central bank\u2019s share of the collateralised liquidity window. This signals to the world that Renminbi can also play a global role for liquidity purposes.\nAlthough China has made considerable efforts to expand the use of the Renminbi in recent years, a less transparent and underdeveloped financial system, continued capital control measures, and limitations on Renminbi convertibility hinder further internationalisation of its currency. The share of the Renminbi in global reserve portfolios, at 2 per cent, pales in comparison with those of the US dollar and the Euro. As a country with a less open system and lacking transparent policies, it remains to be seen how far China can inspire the confidence of the global community in the Renminbi.\nEichengreen, et al. (2022) argue that China can adopt its model of the Renminbi as long as certain economic fundamentals are met. The economic prerequisites include the backing of the currency by foreign exchange reserves, liquidity support through central bank swaps and calibrated access for foreigners to onshore investment opportunities."

    "output": "Some of the key takeaways for the Inter Departmental Group (IDG) from the experience of Renminbi internationalisation are:\n(i) Full capital account convertibility seems to be a desirable but not necessary pre-condition to the internationalisation of a currency. However, the central bank needs to be ready to provide liquidity (for example through bilateral swap arrangements) and allow conversion into other currencies.\n(ii) The Chinese authorities have leveraged Hong Kong to increase the internationalisation of their currency. While this move has improved liquidity, particularly in channelising investments, the CNH-CNY currency (and therefore exchange rate) system does not seem to be adding any significant value.\n(iii) There seems to be considerable merit in expanding the use of local currencies, particularly with the largest trading partners. Settlement of trade in local currencies can also be incentivised through fiscal measures, trade policy and enabling financial market infrastructure.\n(iv) The Chinese authorities have adopted a process of slow liberalisation of capital account and financial markets.\n\nRegarding regional settlement mechanisms, the report discusses the South America SML (Sistema de Pagamentos em Moeda Local), which is an international payment system that settles bilateral financial transactions in local currencies within the Southern Common Market (MERCOSUR) countries (Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay). It also mentions the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) Regional Payment and Settlement System (REPSS), a regional payment and settlement initiative administered by the COMESA Clearing House, with the Central Bank of Mauritius acting as the Settlement Bank."

    "output": "Several Central Banks have proposed a Local Currency Settlement (LCS) framework with India to promote wider use of local currencies to facilitate and boost trade and investment settlement, including remittances. This LCS framework and bilateral currency swap framework are supposed to become a catalyst for the financial market deepening and stability in the region with monetary coordination by central banks. The utility of bilateral currency swaps between central banks, for trade, investment and remittances in the LCS framework will provide liquidity and backstop support. The LCS framework will slowly obviate the need for maintaining large foreign exchange reserves in the long run.\n\nAnother financial cooperation scheme proposed is the \u2018Local Currency Bilateral Swap Arrangement (LCBSA)\u2019 between central banks. It is different from the usual bilateral Currency Swap agreement made for trade, investment, and remittance. The LCBSA is aimed at bilateral financial cooperation in the form of swaps to strengthen liquidity management and boost the development of the domestic financial market to support the economic development of both participating countries. The LCBSA also aims to function as a backstop facility for the implementation of the LCS-based framework. The LCBSA would serve as a regular facility to support each country\u2019s foreign exchange reserves management, even under normal global economic and market conditions. The LCBSA may be utilized at any time without having to formulate specific eligibility criteria.\n\nThe IDG feels that LCS, given its comprehensive approach, may be useful as a favorable model to be adopted for bilateral transactions outside the USD ambit for trade/capital/remittance settlement and transfers. Opening of non-resident accounts in respective domestic currencies would enable such transactions. Further, it can contribute to the gradual development of currency markets, including the development of hedging instruments thereby facilitating direct currency quotes."

    "input": "Question: What steps are necessary to encourage the international usage of INR and manage volatility in forex markets?",
    "output": "Encouraging the international usage of INR requires that sufficient INR liquidity is available at the government and central bank levels (both domestic and foreign). This will provide the requisite confidence to all stakeholders, economic agents and market participants for settling cross-border transactions in INR. With the increase in financial flows globally, there has been greater volatility in forex markets. As seen during the recent COVID pandemic and Ukraine conflict, this volatility transmits shocks through the external sector, and brings macroeconomic and financial sector instability, especially in the EMEs. To manage such volatility and the risks arising therefrom, the IDG observes that the mechanisms of local currency settlement and local currency swap arrangements may prove useful for policymakers to reduce the dependency on convertible currencies for cross-border trade transactions and payment obligations. Local currency settlement provides currency diversification benefits and acts as a natural hedge against currency risk exposure, reduces transaction costs through more efficient direct exchange rates, and facilitates faster payment transfers. Similarly, local currency swaps may also be an important tool for reducing and managing financial risks because they increase liquidity in both the counterpart country and the domestic banking sector.\nFurther, at the level of commercial banks also, sufficient INR liquidity would be required to facilitate transactions in INR through their offshore branches. The IDG, therefore, has studied the extant Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) provisions, regulations, and guidelines, as well as reviewed the existing payment and settlement infrastructure that determines the capability to provide sufficient INR liquidity, irrespective of the geographic locations and time zones. The IDG feels that the availability of INR liquidity would be crucial for INR to be accepted internationally as a settlement currency. The concerns on extending such liquidity have also been studied by the IDG with respect to any potential risk from the monetary policy angle. The IDG opines that these concerns can be handled on a case-to-case basis when the individual LCS/swap arrangements are being agreed upon with the respective partner country depending on various parameters such as the bilateral/multilateral terms of trade, the quantum of liquidity requirement and macroeconomic conditions of the partner country."

It has also examined incentives provided by the Government of India for invoicing and settlement of trade in freely convertible currency to compare them with incentives for INR settlement. The approach includes examining issues related to easing non-residents' access to financial services and investments in surplus INR, revisiting Know Your Customer (KYC)/Anti Money Laundering (AML) requirements, and removing frictions in Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) provisions. Additionally, it addresses procedural and documentation roadblocks faced by investors, such as foreign portfolio investors, to reduce transaction and compliance costs and improve the ease of doing business in India. Highlighting these issues, the IDG has made several recommendations to remove these roadblocks.\n\n2.  **Deepening Indian Financial Markets:** The IDG has deliberated on issues in financial markets, indicating complexities in the extant Foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI) regimes, and examined the need for greater liquidity in the derivative markets. Recognizing the implications of the growth and size of the offshore market on the price discovery of the INR exchange rate, the IDG's approach has been to facilitate incremental but gradual access to onshore financial markets. It also examines ways of promoting India as the hub for INR transactions.\n\n3.  **Approach for Long Term - Scope of INR to be used as a \u201cVehicle Currency\u201d:** The IDG views the possibility of INR being used as a vehicle currency as a long-term goal, resulting from various measures taken and recommended in the report. It recognizes INR's increasing prominence and the growth in global INR forex transactions. As trade linkages, capital account convertibility, financial market depth, and macroeconomic indicators strengthen, the expectation is that other economies will use INR for pegging their currencies and in their forex intervention strategies."

    "output": "In addition to the Indo-Nepal Remittance Scheme, which is an outward payment service, and the Money Transfer Service Scheme (MTSS), which is an inward payment service available through a tie-up between reputed money transfer companies abroad and agents in India, the RBI, in collaboration with the GoI and National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), is reaching out to jurisdictions to increase the global outreach of the UPI system to facilitate cross-border transactions, including remittances. The linkages between fast payment systems across jurisdictions can enhance cross-border payment arrangements and ensure faster remittances. RBI also selected \u2018cross-border payments\u2019 theme in the second cohort under the Regulatory Sandbox initiative to spur innovations capable of recasting the cross -border payments landscape. Further, to ensure continuous innovation, in September 2022, RBI announced that the second cohort on \u201ccross -border payments\u201d was open for \u201cOn -tap\u201d applications.\n\nWith RBI operated centralised payment systems (CPSs), viz., RTGS and NEFT, operating round the clock, the required infrastructure is available, which can be leveraged to interface with similar systems in other jurisdictions to facilitate cross-border payments. RBI is also actively considering the idea of expanding the framework of Structured Financial Messaging System (SFMS) to provide the domestic payment system platform to other jurisdictions. The suggested SFMS based RTGS platform model providing the infrastructure for cross-border payments is detailed in the flow depicted in Annex 3.2. This could be expected to provide faster, convenient and cost-effective direct payment channels with other jurisdictions."

    "output": "The path to the internationalisation of a currency is intertwined with that of the nation\u2019s economic progress. The post-reform era from 1991 onwards has hastened the process of capital mobility and domestic financial market integration with global markets, creating a favourable ecosystem for the internationalisation of INR. The public policy roadmap towards fuller capital account convertibility and internationalisation of INR has been aimed at (i) gradually liberalising the capital account, (ii) promoting the international use of INR, and (iii) strengthening financial markets. Against this backdrop, the views of IDG on the current status of internationalisation of INR, the further steps that may be taken and the challenges therein are described in this chapter based on the broad approach outlined in Chapter 3.\nInternationalisation of the INR and capital account convertibility are processes which are both closely and symbiotically intertwined with each other. Recent policy measures for further liberalising the capital account have tended to adopt a more principle-based approach targeted at replacing several rule -based and hard -coded provisions. Thus, recent initiatives such as the Medium-Term Framework (MTF), Voluntary Retention Route (VRR) and Fully Accessible Route (FAR) for investments by FPIs in debt securities, Revised External Commercial Borrowings (ECB) Framework (2019) and the Overseas Investment Rules and Regulations, have reinforced the overarching template of liberalisation with some macroprudential checks and balances. Procedural constraints have been relaxed to a large extent. In terms of usage of INR, major policy measures include ECB in INR and Masala bonds and expansion of scope for deposit accounts in INR for non -residents [Special Non-Resident Rupee Account \u2013 (SNRR account)]. The present position of INR provisions under FEMA, 1999, is given in Annex 4.1.\nNevertheless, there continue to be certain extant FEMA provisions and other restrictions which may come in the way of wider international usage of the INR for cross -border transactions. The same have been elaborated below. Further, the extant provisions concerning the opening of INR accounts and providing banking services to non-residents as well as the various issues relating to the extant FPI regimes have also been discussed.\nRBI has already put in place an additional arrangement for invoicing, payment, and settlement of exports/ imports in INR through Special Rupee vostro account. However, specific multilateral/bilateral arrangements that mandate settlement in FCY, need to be addressed on a mutual basis. For example, contracts (for which payments are received through Asian Clearing Union (ACU)) are denominated only in ACU Dollar or ACU Yen or ACU Euro. Some countries have been permitted to settle trade transactions outside ACU mechanism due to geo -political and macroeconomic assessments. However, RBI in consultation with the Government may consider further encouraging the use of INR as the settlement currency under these multilateral/bilateral arrangements."

    "input": "Question: What are some of the FEMA provisions that need to be reviewed and what incentives should be extended for international trade settlements in INR, as discussed by the Inter Departmental Group on Internationalisation of INR?",
    "output": "The Inter Departmental Group on Internationalisation of INR discusses some of the FEMA provisions that need review, including insufficient incentives for INR trade settlement, restrictions on SNRR accounts, long-term Rupee Denominated Bonds (RDBs) tenors, withholding tax on Masala bond issuance, absence of a local currency settlement framework, and lack of INR finance options for non-residents (excluding NRIs/OCIs). To address these issues, there is a need for a review of the extant FEMA provisions and for extending incentives for international trade settlements in INR. Specifically:\n\n1) Sufficient incentives are not present for the settlement of trade transactions in INR. Export proceeds realised in Indian Rupees against exports to Iran are only permitted to avail export benefits/incentives under the Foreign Trade Policy (2015 - 20), at par with export proceeds realised in freely convertible currency. This needs to be extended and made universal (for all INR-based trade transactions with all countries) by the Government.\n\n2) SNRR accounts carry the nomenclature of the specific business for which it is in operation. An Indian bank may, at its discretion, maintain separate SNRR accounts for each category of transaction or a single SNRR account for a person resident outside India engaged in multiple categories of transactions provided it can identify/segregate and account for them category -wise. However, the SNRR accounts\u2019 credit balances cannot be debited for purposes other than those pertaining to the said credit, for example, credits from trade transactions cannot be used for making FDI or FPI in India. SNRR account cannot also be utilised for FDI (other than by Foreign Venture Capital Investors - FCVIs), etc. Further, it is a non-interest-bearing account. Thus, there is a case for allowing a single SNRR account for non-residents that may be used for all permissible capital and current account transactions.\n\n3) Indian banks are permitted by RBI to issue long -term Rupee Denominated Bonds (RDBs) overseas for financing infrastructure and affordable housing having a minimum tenor of 7 years. This is a prudential concern of matching maturities of assets and liabilities of a bank and hence this view was taken by RBI on minimum tenor while permitting banks to issue Masala bonds. However, other financial intermediaries, like Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs), are permitted to raise RDBs with a minimum tenor of 3 years. This may be one of the reasons that there has been little appetite for masala bond issuances by Indian banks for a tenor of 7 years.\n\n4) Presently withholding tax of 5 per cent applies to Masala bond issuance. This is a preferential rate of tax, which the government had permitted after due consideration, reducing it from 20 per cent applicable to other non-specified types of interest. However, even this appears to tilt the cost materially and adversely for INR-denominated ECBs through Masala bonds.\n\n5) The extant mechanism links INR value with INR-denominated ECBs, whereas settlement occurs primarily in freely convertible currencies. A local currency settlement framework is absent.\n\n6) There is no mechanism for providing INR finance from the Indian banking system to non-residents other than NRI/Overseas Citizens of India (OCIs).\n\nAdditionally, the Inter Departmental Group mentions that the ability to open bank accounts in the currency of a country outside that country is a foundational element of internationalisation of a currency. At present, non -residents can open only onshore INR accounts and these accounts can be utilised only for payments/receipts in respect of a limited set."

    "output": "As part of the efforts at internationalisation of INR, the possibility of settling all permissible capital and current account transactions through both onshore and offshore INR accounts may be considered. To begin with, non-residents may be allowed to open INR accounts only with the overseas branches of Authorised Dealers (ADs) for undertaking current and capital account transactions permitted under FEMA, 1999. Later, based on experience and system readiness, opening INR accounts with any overseas bank without restrictions may be considered.\n\nTo promote INR as an international currency, it is necessary to increase its usage in trade, services, and financial market transactions. This requires Indian banks to provide banking services (loans, guarantees, credit lines, etc.) in INR to non-residents. Currently, the RBI approves Indian banks' foreign offices under the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, but the guidelines have not specifically addressed banking business in INR through offshore branches. Accordingly, existing regulations need to be revisited and changed as required."

For Corporate Bonds, one solution is to impart certainty to VRR by setting investment limits in percentage terms of outstanding corporate bonds and reviewing annually, like the MTF. Another solution involves rationalising macroprudential controls under the MTF by removing the short-term limit and the concentration limit."

    "output": "As financial flows have increased in the 21st century, sudden stops and reversals have also increased in frequency. This increased volatility in forex markets can transmit shocks to destabilise the external sector, and macroeconomic and financial sector stability, especially for Emerging Market Economies (EMEs). The recent COVID pandemic as well as the Ukraine conflict has proved that these risks can snowball into serious and sudden external sector vulnerabilities. Towards managing these risks, local currency settlement and currency swap arrangements are tools for policymakers to reduce dependency on convertible currencies, like the USD, for cross-border trade transactions. Further, an overview of the past and existing examples of such arrangements, especially in the Indian context, are given in Annex 4.2.\n\nA review of the cross-country experience has shown that a local currency settlement provides currency diversification that stabilises the local currency and provides a natural hedge for the business community to protect against currency risk exposure, reduces transaction costs through more efficient direct rates, and facilitates faster transfers. The LCS framework follows a comprehensive approach as it attempts to expansively cover issues inter alia relating to the establishment of correspondent banking relationships in local currencies, use of national payment systems, the requirement for bilateral domestic currency swaps, hedging, etc. A common template can be adopted while entering into such an arrangement with the partner countries. Subsequently, a local currency swap arrangement can be explored to supplement the LCS arrangement and its emergent liquidity requirements. Local currency swaps that allow central banks to exchange domestic currencies with each other are important tools for reducing/managing financial risks. Encouraging the international usage of the INR requires that after a certain threshold level of settlement of bilateral transactions is achieved in INR, sufficient liquidity in INR is available at government to government/central bank to central bank level. Hedging may be operationally challenging for all the stakeholders while adhering to two different regimes and the position may become more complex in case more such bilateral arrangements are entered into in the future. However, it is felt that to the extent possible, these differences may be narrowed down. Accordingly, users in each country may be permitted to hedge their exposures as per the regulatory regime in place in that country with only the incremental permissions/prohibitions being stipulated. This approach will allow the market to take up the local currency settlement without much difficulty. It will also help in simplifying the framework and minimising the need for future changes.\n\nSome challenges in the context of LCS and liquidity are:\ni. While negotiating swap lines in soft currencies, the challenge of exploring avenues for investments of surplus Local Currencies (LCYs) in the country of issuance has to be addressed. A suitable examination of the avenues, based on the mutual consent of both countries, has to be undertaken.\nii. For determining the exchange rate for conversion of cross currencies, direct quotes may not be available. Initially, the exchange rate with reference to the USD or another third currency may need to be referred to for determining the external value of the currency. Over a period of time, as the market develops and turnover reaches a certain threshold, direct quotes would also become available.\niii. Suitable cross border payment mechanisms leveraging on domestic payment systems like UPI/RTGS/ indigenous card networks need to be devised which may need considerable time for exploration and development."

These challenges have been acknowledged by the IDG, and the proposed solutions to each of these have been discussed in Chapter 5. Overall, there is a need for formulating a framework/common template or standardized approach for Local Currency Settlement Mechanisms and bilateral trade agreements, which will help incrementally internationalise the INR."

However, in the short run, there may not be any impact on the money supply as any currency takes a long time to become a popular global currency among traders/investors. Further, liquidity management tools at the disposal of the monetary authorities can always prevent a runaway monetary expansion, resulting from automatic adjustment.

For this, sufficient liquidity has to be ensured in the global systems, and the concerns arising out of these liquidity arrangements can be managed on a case-specific basis. Participation of non-residents in the G-sec market through ICSDs can further expand the G-sec investor base and help in lowering the cost of Government borrowings. Lastly, leveraging our efficient payment systems and initiating the process of inclusion of INR in CLS have a strong potential to promote the internationalisation of INR. Furthermore, for attaining the objective of INR as a \u201cVehicle Currency\u201d, the Bank may target its inclusion in the SDR basket."

    "output": "The recent measures taken by the Bank have significantly changed the regulatory landscape, creating a conducive ecosystem for taking the financial markets to the next level of development and sophistication. Internationalisation of the INR requires non-residents (NRs) to acquire, hold and dispose of financial assets in India with ease. This will encourage NRs to maintain INR-denominated accounts, the balances of which could be freely utilised for gainful investment in Indian financial markets. The feedback/suggestions on procedural and documentation issues as received from market participants are highlighted in this section:\n\n(i) Harmonisation of KYC norms of RBI and SEBI to take care of category of FPIs, KYC documentation and certification of Officially Valid Documents (OVD)\nInvestors and custodians have been indicating in various forums that Indian KYC regulations are relatively more stringent compared to international financial centres. Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has made certain changes to their regulations to simplify the KYC process. To ease access of foreign investors to INR assets, efforts may be undertaken to harmonise the KYC regulations of RBI and SEBI. (a) Category of FPIs: The SEBI\u2019s operational guidelines recategorised the FPIs in two categories from three earlier. Most of the FPIs in category II were recategorised as Category I. The RBI\u2019s Master Direction (MD) for Know Your Customer (KYC), however, still consists of three categories. The KYC requirements differ for these three categories. (b) KYC documentation: The revised SEBI guidelines did away with most of the KYC documentation for authorised signatories and the Ultimate Beneficial Owner (UBO). Details such as name, nationality, date of birth, address and Government issued ID number are disclosed in the Common Application Form (CAF). Now, only the document for proof of identity of the UBO is required by SEBI. The RBI\u2019s Master Direction still requires the FPIs to submit proof of identity documents for both authorised signatories and UBO. (c) Certification of Officially Valid Documents (OVD): SEBI KYC requirement permits copies to be attested by entities authorized for attesting the documents like notary public/officials of multinational foreign banks or any bank regulated by RBI. The RBI\u2019s Master Direction, on the other hand, requires banks to collect certified copies of OVD by comparing a copy of the OVD with the original. While it accepts notarised documents for NRIs, there is no such provision for the other non-residents.\n\n(ii) KYC at investment manager level instead of fund level\nThe current KYC requirement for FPIs is at each FPI level which means that for every scheme/fund of an investment manager, the entire KYC is repeated. The funds/schemes of an investment manager usually differ only by their prospectus while most of the other information remains the same.\n\n(iii) KYC reliance on Global Custodians and third parties\nMarket participants suggest acceptance of KYC performed by Global custodians (GCs) for entities coming through global custodians for registration. GCs typically appoint one or more local custodians to service their client accounts in India. The local market servicing arrangements operate under an agreement that runs between the GC and the local custodian. GCs follow global KYC procedures that consist of having robust"

Indian banks have now been accessing the Non-deliverable Forward (NDF) markets for more than two years.

However, the activity of Indian banks in offshore markets has remained concentrated. The share of transactions\u2019 turnover handled by AD Cat -I banks in the offshore market has remained below 10 per cent of the overall turnover. Due to the requirement of having an IBU, a section of AD Cat-I banks is not eligible to deal in Rupee NDDCs leading to a loss of opportunity. Such ADs account for about half of the interbank and about one -third of the customer activity in the domestic market (as shown in table 4.1 below).\n\nEfficient integration of the onshore and offshore markets can be fully achieved only with the participation of all domestic banks in the Rupee NDDC market."

    "input": "Question: How can the onshore forex derivative market be improved to promote INR price discovery, and what phased approach is suggested for liberalization?",
    "output": "Allowing participants to freely access the onshore forex derivative market without the need for underlying exposure may help further enhance liquidity in the onshore market and thereby promote it as the main center of INR price discovery. The need for an underlying exposure has been removed in related derivative markets, viz., interest rate and credit derivative markets for non-retail (larger) customers and there is no requirement for an underlying exposure in the case of equity derivatives. It is felt that this liberalization may be undertaken in a phased manner. In the first phase, resident users may be allowed to undertake non-deliverable INR forex derivatives without any restrictions in terms of purpose, bringing them at par with non -resident users. In subsequent phases, users (both resident and non -resident) may be allowed to access the exchange-traded and the deliverable forex derivative markets without any restriction in terms of purpose. Currently, customers can undertake INR forex derivative positions (OTC and exchange-traded) to hedge only (except non-resident users who can undertake non-deliverable INR forex derivatives without the requirement of underlying exposure). This limits the liquidity and depth of domestic markets. One of the main reasons for the rapid growth of offshore markets is their ability to undertake derivative transactions without the requirement of an underlying exposure and/or the requirement to demonstrate the existence of underlying exposure. In the onshore market, this requirement is stipulated as part of the capital account and exchange rate management framework. However, the volatility from view-based positions in offshore markets is already being transmitted to the onshore market through various inter-market linkages. Further, participants with large positions, viz., ADs, stockbrokers and non-resident investors are already permitted to take view-based positions in the onshore market (albeit in the case of the ADs and stockbrokers, such positions are subject to position limits)."

    "output": "To foster a global 24x5 INR market, inter-bank forex transactions should be permitted through overseas branches and subsidiaries of AD banks, enabling AD Cat-I banks to make a market in INR round-the-clock. In the first phase, all inter-bank transactions between two AD Cat-I banks may be permitted, while deliverable inter-bank transactions between an AD Cat-I bank and an overseas bank may be permitted only for fulfilling the INR requirements of the overseas bank (funding the INR nostro account, hedging, etc.). Similarly, market-makers in the interest rate derivative market may also be allowed to undertake customer and inter-bank transactions through their overseas branches and subsidiaries in addition to dealing from their domestic branches. This will ensure that a bouquet of INR forex and interest rate products is available internationally on a 24x5 basis without the necessity of round-the-clock operations of the onshore market. As a complementary measure, the possibility of extending the operational hours of CCIL-operated trading platforms, viz., FX-CLEAR, FX-SWAP and Anonymous System for Trading in Rupee OTC Interest Rate Derivatives (ASTROID) to enable overseas branches and subsidiaries to continuously discover prices and provide liquidity could also be examined.\n\nThe possibility of a BISIP-INR may be viewed positively as eventually these investments will lead to a deep and liquid bond market. Also, investment through BISIP in G-secs may increase the level of foreign exchange reserves, which are expected to be stable inflows as the investors in BISIP-INR will be central banks. The IDG feels that such a fund may act as a step towards internationalisation of INR in that (i) it will eventually lead to acceptance of INR as a reserve currency, which in turn may aid the inclusion of INR in the SDR basket, and (ii) it will provide a platform for integration of Indian financial market with global financial markets and in turn contribute towards encouraging the inclusion of Indian government securities in global bond indices.\n\nThere are several advantages of getting included in global bond indices, viz., (a) Widening of investor base: The non-resident investor base in Indian government bonds has largely remained stagnant resulting in continued reliance on banks and other institutional investors, such as insurance companies to support government borrowing needs. Tapping the large assets under management (AUM) of funds tracking global bond indices will help in meeting the growing borrowing needs of the country; and (b) Stable passive flows: Globally, there is an increasing trend of passive investing, especially by large investors such as pension funds, insurances, etc., by following the bond indices.

    "output": "Including Indian Government Bonds (IGBs) in global bond indices has several advantages, including widening the investor base, attracting stable passive flows, and potentially improving the country's structural balance of payments position by ushering in an environment of lower cost of capital and higher growth. The funds tracking the three major global bond indices (JP Morgan, FTSE Russel and Bloomberg-Barclays) combined is more than USD 5 trillion. Countries that are not part of Global bond indices can only receive second-order flows from active investors. The likely benefits include large immediate inflows on inclusion in one or more global bond indices followed by steady incremental annual inflows, flattening of G-sec yield curve, appreciation of the INR, reduction of overall borrowing costs with tightening of bid-ask spreads, and improvement in foreign flows to corporate bonds. However, there are also associated risks, such as increased sensitivity of domestic policy to external spillovers, fiscal and monetary policies needing to be more cognizant of global perception and sensitivities, and the potential cost for sterilisation and associated market operations owing to large inflows. Such risks generally materialise when concerns emerge about the fiscal health of the country with potential rating downgrades or de-platforming from the index. The improving macro-stability conditions of India provide comfort in this context. On the whole, the benefits of index inclusion appear to outweigh the concerns associated with it. RBI has been engaging with index providers, viz., JP Morgan, FTSE Russel and Bloomberg -Barclays for the inclusion of IGBs in global bond indices. These interactions suggest that there is increasing interest in the inclusion of Indian Government Bonds (IGBs) in global indices given the reforms carried out in financial markets, including markets for hedging of interest rate and currency risks, opening up of bond markets to investors, operationalisation of FAR, etc. India is already on the watch list for inclusion in two indices (JP Morgan Global Bond Index \u2013 Emerging Markets and FTSE Emerging Markets Global Bond Index).

    "output": "The IDG has deliberated all the issues in the Terms of Reference in a granular manner and recommends a set of time-bound steps, which would accelerate the pace of internationalisation of INR. The Group notes that some of these steps may have already been initiated, either internally or as a part of other Groups and some are currently work in progress. The Group recognises that the internationalisation of INR is a process rather than an event, and thus to enable, track and monitor the progress, certain milestones for implementation have been recommended. The timeframe of different recommendations is suggested depending upon th e institutional capacity, preparedness and priority of macroeconomic supporting conditions. \n\nAfter discussing the rationale for the need for further reforms in the previous chapters, the IDG recommends the following measures for their implementation: \n(I) Short Term Goals: Timeline for implementation: up to 2 years \n1. Standardised approach for Central Bank (INR/FCY) swaps and multilateral/bilateral trade arrangements: In the recent past, RBI has been receiving a large number of proposals from various jurisdictions for multilateral/bilateral swaps and trade arrangements in local currencies. These are being examined separately by various departments, in consultation with the Government. A standardised approach/uniform template, which was recently prepared by DEIO (as detailed in Annex 5.1), is recommended for adoption."

    "output": "The Inter Departmental Group (IDG) recommends the following short-term goals for implementation within 2 years:\n\n1.  **Standardised approach for Central Bank (INR/FCY) swaps and multilateral/bilateral trade arrangements:** Adopt a uniform template for examining proposals involving bilateral and multilateral trade agreements/arrangements for invoicing, settlement, and payment in INR and local currencies. The objective is to identify the terms of trade and how surplus currency can be mutually deployed.\n\n2.  **Leverage existing bilateral and multilateral currency settlement systems:** Utilize mechanisms like the ACU to internationalize INR by encouraging its use as an additional settlement currency.\n\n3.  **Facilitating and encouraging Local Currency Settlement (LCS) and implementation of a liquidity framework:** Examine the LCS framework after analyzing terms of trade, ensuring adequate INR liquidity in both international and domestic banking sectors.\n\n4.  **Operationalising Swaps in Local Currencies (LCYs):** Address investment avenues for surplus LCYs based on mutual consent, using FDI, FPI, debt, projects, deposits, etc.  Initially, use a third currency like USD for exchange rate conversion, but transition to market-driven rates over time.  Consider alternative messaging (SFMS), cross-border payments, and national payment systems (RTGS, NEFT, UPI) to reduce transaction costs and expand access. Encourage Indian commercial banks to establish correspondent banking relationships in INR and counterparty currencies.\n\n5.  **Opening of INR Accounts by non-residents:** Allow non-residents (excluding banks) to open INR accounts with overseas branches of Authorised Dealers."

    "output": "Pursuing the Renminbi\u2019s internationalisation is of evident benefit to China, both from a political and economic standpoint. The importance further grew on the back of the growing need to counter the dollar trap and extend Beijing\u2019s global influence. The Chinese Renminbi is making deeper inroads as a currency of choice for global payments. This would enable the currency to have certain benefits like: Reduction of exchange rate risks to which Chinese firms are exposed; Greater funding cost-effectiveness for Chinese financial institutions, thus strengthening their competitiveness in global financial markets; A boost to China\u2019s trade with its neighbours, owing to the reduction in transaction costs; Less need for China to hold US dollar assets and risk capital losses on the country\u2019s foreign exchange reserves; Eventual status as one of the world\u2019s major reserve currencies would give China more freedom to manoeuvre domestic and international markets. In pursuance of its goal of securing increased Renminbi use internationally, China launched the offshore Renminbi (CNH) in 2009 and signed currency swap agreements with numerous countries. However, the need for capital control measures, limited Renminbi convertibility on the capital account and a not -yet mature financial sector are still major challenges ahead."

    "output": "Under the aegis of ACU, RBI floated a proposal of \u201cUse of domestic currency in the ACU mechanism\u201d considering the benefits that would accrue to the members given the relatively freer availability of domestic currencies, especially INR. The proposed mechanism may include the following:\n\nSettlement Mechanism: A mechanism has to be developed in the ACU to calculate and advise daily cross-currency exchange rates. To encourage trade financing under the mechanism, enhancing swap arrangements and exploring Multilateral Currency Swap Arrangements may be considered. A settlement mechanism has to be set up to enable the settlement of accounts using an automated clearing system mapping end-to-end participants of the ACU mechanism. In case the bi-monthly settlement happens in freely convertible currency, then the methodology of converting debt denominated in local currency into freely convertible currency and the pricing of the debt needs to be formulated.\n\nTrade Invoicing: As trade invoicing was a major catalyst in promoting the usage of local currencies, invoicing of trade in domestic currencies needs to be encouraged by facilitating a more liberal trade policy in each jurisdiction coupled with an enabling regulatory environment.\n\nRegulatory aspects: To ensure a smooth flow of transactions from end-to-end, the group recommended that members may contemplate putting in place requisite approvals from the concerned authorities in their respective jurisdiction, e.g., the exchange control authorities and the Government in each of the countries would need to bring in regulatory changes enabling one or more options for utilisation of possible accumulations in debtor countries. This will formally allow its currency to be used as a settlement currency for ACU transactions.\n\nThe utilisation of trade surplus: The usage of surplus currencies as a result of trade surplus has to be facilitated to enable the bi-monthly settlement in domestic currencies. It is recommended alternative avenues of investment arising from the trade surplus like investment in interest-bearing fixed deposits, FDI/FPI, including Government securities and high-rated corporate bonds and netting through invisibles, including tourism, among others."

    "output": "For any country with which there is a desire to have a payment and settlement arrangement, the RTGS platform (with the multicurrency feature enabled in RTGS) can be leveraged. For this purpose, a new compartment within RTGS set up, say international RTGS (IRTGS), can be created. The banks in other countries will be offered IRTGS membership for transacting in respective international currencies and/or INR with other participating banks in the IRTGS ecosystem. The IRTGS can be used in two modules, viz., 1. For the transactions internal to the country in the currency of the country and 2. For all cross-border transactions between countries in internationally accepted currencies, including INR. To enable this, the international banks will be given direct or sub-membership (Sponsor bank model) depending upon the available infrastructure in that country. One bank in each country can be the nodal bank and other banks of that country can be its sub-members. The sub-member banks of other countries would use any available secured communication line to send SFMS messages to their nodal bank through the SFMS application provided to them. The nodal bank of each participating country would be extended Indian Financial Network (INFINET) membership, and they will, after requisite due diligence, push their and sub-member messages to IRTGS through an international Hub (say managed by Indian Financial Technology and Allied Services - IFTAS or Primary Data Centre) using INFINET. Each of the nodal banks will have a settlement account in RBI for internationally accepted currency/INR, while for other local currencies for national transactions each sub-member will have settlement accounts with nodal banks for which they will have their pledged currency deposits with nodal banks. It can be contemplated whether, for shortfalls, any liquidity support is to be extended. The bank of country A can through its nodal bank transact for a particular currency with a bank in country B (also a participant in IRTGS) for which payment and settlement will happen through the IRTGS. The settlement will be guaranteed through the nodal banks where sub-members would have pledged deposits/collaterals to avoid settlement risk. IRTGS can work as a platform for cross-border trade transaction settlements in INR and/or as a central platform offering multi-currency payment and settlement services for member banks from participating countries."

NRI/OCI card holders can additionally place deposits with a company or a proprietorship concern/firm. However, non-residents cannot open INR accounts overseas.\n\nTrade invoicing in INR is permitted without specific restrictions under FEMA, 1999. Export contracts and invoices should be denominated in freely convertible currency or INR, but export proceeds must be realized in freely convertible currency, unless it is through a freely convertible vostro account of a non-resident bank outside the Asian Clearing Union (ACU), Nepal, or Bhutan. Payments for imports can also be made in INR through a freely convertible vostro account for countries outside ACU, Nepal, or Bhutan. Export proceeds realized in Indian Rupees against exports to Iran are permitted to avail export benefits/ incentives under the FTP, at par with export proceeds realized in freely convertible currency.\n\nAD banks in India can open Rupee vostro accounts. For settlement of trade transactions in INR with any country, AD banks in India can open Special Rupee vostro accounts of correspondent banks of the trading partner country. Rupee payments for imports can be credited to these accounts, and the funds can be used for making payments for exports from India. FTP has been amended to align with this provision.\n\nEligible entities resident in India can raise overseas borrowings under the External Commercial Borrowings (ECB) framework, including in INR, through loan agreements, non-convertible and optionally convertible debentures and preference shares, trade credits beyond 3 years, and financial leases. INR ECB can also be raised through marketable instruments (bonds) known as Rupee denominated bonds (Masala bonds). The overarching ECB framework requires compliance to various parameters like minimum average maturity period, permitted end-uses, recognised lenders, eligible borrowers, all-in-cost ceiling, hedging requirements, etc. INR denominated ECBs, including Masala bonds, are provided with a liberal dispensation in some of these parameters.

RBI may encourage domestic commercial banks to establish negotiated lines of credit for clearing purposes. Some relaxation in provisioning/risk weight may be permitted by RBI to encourage them to establish such negotiated lines of credit.\n2.  In case of further requirements of funds, these foreign entities can also arrange funds through arrangements with major domestic commercial banks (by paying commitment fees or any other suitable arrangements).\n3.  Alternatively, the financial institutions may get INR liquidity through their central banks who may, in turn, get INR funding through bilateral/multilateral swaps.\n4.  Going forward, a repo facility in INR on the lines of LAF may be explored for foreign central banks.\n\nOverseas INR liquidity to offshore Indian banking institutions should be provided by their onshore parent, which will help the Reserve Bank keep its balance sheet protected to an extent and only act as a lender of last resort, whenever required."

Going forward, a scheme similar to LAF may be explored for these foreign central banks/sovereign backed entities based on evolving market conditions.\n\nThe concerns are that the RBI liquidity support for INR internationalisation should be of modest amounts so that it does not impede the public policy objectives of low and stable inflation with desired growth.\n\nRecommended solutions are:\n1. The RBI may get into a swap arrangement with those central banks.\n2. As the lender of last resort, RBI can formulate a scheme akin to the LAF facility which is currently extended to participating banks. Under this scheme, the other central banks and Sovereign -backed entities, that have investments in G -secs may be allowed fixed rate repo and fixed rate reverse repo/standing deposit facility for an extended period. This design would also help minimise the risk on the balance sheet of the Bank. This will be in addition to the other avenues for the deployment of surplus funds.\n3. These central banks and sovereign -backed entities, which avail INR liquidity from the RBI, can be allowed to act as clearing agents for the entities under their jurisdiction.\n4.

    "output": "The Reserve Bank of India and the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) have announced a project to link their fast payment systems, UPI and PayNow. The linkage will enable users of the two systems to make instant fund transfers (remittances) without the need to get onboarded onto the other system. In other words, a user of UPI does not require to be a part of the PayNow system to be able to transfer funds to a PayNow user in Singapore and vice versa. The linkage builds upon the earlier efforts of NPCI International Payments Limited (NIPL, a subsidiary of NPCI) and Network for Electronic Transfers (NETS of Singapore) to facilitate QR code-based payments through UPI in Singapore. The initiative is in line with the Reserve Bank\u2019s vision of reviewing inbound remittance corridors between India and other countries.\n\nThe UPI -PayNow linkage can foster cross -border interoperability of payments and provide impetus to retail payments during travel and remittance flows in domestic currencies between the two countries. Singapore has a large number of Indian workers and students, resulting in substantial (more than USD 1 billion) in -bound and out-bound remittances every year. The UPI -PayNow linkage is expected to be a significant milestone in the development of infrastructure for cross -border payments between India and Singapore and aligns with the G20\u2019s financial inclusion priority of enabling faster, cheaper and more transparent cross -border payments. It can also contribute to fulfilling United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 10.c) by reducing the cost of remittances.\n\nUnderstanding the UPI-PayNow system: The present settlements are through nostro/vostro accounts between two banks \u2013 one each on India and Singapore side. There would not be any change in it with the operationalisation of the linkage.\n\nThe benefits that the linkage will bring would not be about the settlement aspect but on others, such as ease, speed, and cost of transactions:\ni. Ease of performing the transaction, as it would be executed through Virtual Payment Address (VPA)/mobile number/national id without a need to get onboarded onto the other payment system.\nii. Near real-time payments, as against the present settlement period of at least one working day.\niii. Enhanced transparency, as the applicable foreign exchange rates and charges shall be visible before confirming the transaction.\niv. Lower cost of transaction due to reduced time of payment and settlement, resulting in lower markup by the participating banks.\n\nDetailed discussions with NPCI revealed that the current UPI system can be upgraded to include all types of transactions. The benefits accruing from the real -time payments feature of UPI and the low cost of UPI transactions can prove to be attractive for personal and retail transactions and a game changer for cross -border remittances. The UPI-based payment system can be implemented in its existing form with enhancements, and tie-ups between banks across borders for retail segments, remittances and foreign travel can be instituted. Trade and other related international trans actions, apart from the upgrade of the UPI system, will also require certain additions in the processes by the banking industry and examination of reporting and regulatory compliance requirements. For this, close collaboration between the RBI, NPCI and the banking industry would be required."

The IMF lists the position of currency in official reserves as an indicator of use by public authorities, and the sum of international bank liabilities (IBL) and international debt securities (IDS) as an indicator of currency used in private international finance transactions. The INR has gained prominence over the years, particularly since 2010. In terms of the overall ranking across currencies with respect to the over -the-counter (OTC) foreign exchange turnover, the INR was ranked at 16 in 2019, higher than 18 in 2016.

    "output": "The Reserve Bank has been engaged in developing a deep and liquid onshore foreign exchange market. Recognizing the existence of bidirectional price linkages between onshore and offshore rates, the possibility of volatility spillovers from offshore markets, and segmentation between onshore and offshore markets impairing the efficiency of price discovery and undermining the regulatory framework, recent regulatory efforts have focused on improving access to the onshore markets by residents and non -residents while facilitating product innovation. On May 8, 2020, the two IFSC Exchanges, India International Exchange Limited (India INX) and NSE IFSC Limited (NSE IFSC), launched INR derivative contracts. Banks in India which operate IFSC Banking Units (IBUs) were permitted to participate in the NDF markets with effect from June 1, 2020. Fourteen Indian banks have started participating in the INR NDF markets since then. The daily turnover of these banks has steadily increased from less than USD 1 billion in the initial days to about USD 4 billion in the recent period. The participation of Indian banks in the NDF market appears to have positively impacted the price differential between offshore and onshore rates. Similar to growth in offshore NDF markets, an active market for Rupee interest rate swaps (IRS) has been growing offshore, with the most popular instrument being the non -deliverable overnight indexed swaps (ND-OIS), similar to onshore Mumbai Interbank Offered Rate (MIBOR) referenced OIS contracts. Recognising that this has effectively segmented the Rupee interest rate swaps (IRS) market between the onshore and the offshore markets impeding efficient price discovery, and to develop a deeper onshore market, non -residents were permitted to access the onshore interest rate derivative market in 2019. Post this, the participation of non -residents has increased in the onshore markets and the segmentation between onshore and offshore markets has reduced. The average spread between onshore MIBOR OIS rates and ND-OIS rates has fallen from a range of 7 -21 basis points to 1 -2 basis points in 2021 -22. To provide a further fillip to the interest rate derivative market in the country and improve the efficiency of price discovery, banks in India have been recently permitted to undertake transactions in the offshore Foreign Currency Settled Overnight Indexed Swap (FCS -OIS) market with non -residents and other market makers. Importantly, an onshore interbank market in non-deliverable derivatives is emerging wherein local banks transact with each other. The participation of Indian banks in the NDF/FCS-OIS market has increased avenues for interbank risk management and, going forward, could help bring down the hedging cost for customers."

Identifying a mechanism for working out (as far as possible market-determined and real-time) a daily exchange rate between the INR and other currency/ies through a third currency (say USD, etc.) for settling the transactions. The requirement and availability of hedging tools may also be examined for NRs who are exposed to currency risks owing to their open positions in INR.\n5.  Exploring the extension of Government incentives which are available for trade transactions in convertible currencies (Table A5.3) to the trade transactions being settled in local currencies.\n6.  Exploring the possibility of extending domestic payment systems/mechanisms such as UPI, NEFT and RTGS to the participating country/ies or integrating the existing payment systems of the participating countries (to enable seamless payments and receipt for cross-border trade transactions).\n7.  Exploring the feasibility of inclusion of local currencies in the Foreign Currency Assets (FCA)/Foreign Exchange Reserves (FER) in accordance with the IMF definition.\n8.  Enabling a mechanism for facilitating trade payments using commercial banks and central banks.

    "input": "Question: What is the purpose of liquidity management in monetary policy, and how has the Reserve Bank's approach evolved?",
    "output": "Liquidity management is the operating procedure of monetary policy, primarily aiming to align the targeted money market rate to the policy rate, to achieve the first step in monetary policy transmission. An effective Liquidity Management Framework (LMF) facilitates the maintenance of appropriate liquidity in the banking system and fosters money market development. The Reserve Bank's LMF has undergone a process of continuous refinement over the past two decades, driven by the dynamic nature of the macroeconomic and financial environment. The Reserve Bank\u2019s current LMF, implemented in February 2020, has been operative for more than five years, with a brief pause during the COVID-19 pandemic. This period has provided valuable insights into the LMF's effectiveness during episodes of global shocks such as COVID-19, the war in Ukraine and the global monetary tightening cycle. Moreover, during this period, there have also been certain domestic structural changes, including increased digital payments, the operationalisation of a 24x365 payments system and adoption of \u201cJust-in-Time\u201d release of Centrally Sponsored Schemes funds. These developments have significantly influenced the liquidity management paradigm. In addition, capital flows have continued to exhibit large volatility with significant implications for system liquidity. In view of the factors discussed above, the Reserve Bank constituted an Internal Working Group (IWG) to evaluate the current LMF and suggest appropriate changes for effective transmission of monetary policy. The recommendations made by the Group in this report along with their rationale are summarised below."

    "instruction": "Answer the question based on the provided context from the financial report.",
    "input": "Question: What factors support the continuation of the overnight Weighted Average Call Rate (WACR) as the operating target for monetary policy, and what considerations should the Reserve Bank maintain regarding other overnight segments?",
    "output": "To achieve monetary policy transmission, it is essential that entities participating in the target segment have access to central bank\u2019s liquidity facilities, that is Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) in case of the Reserve Bank. Further, it is vital that entities leveraging these facilities engage in lending and borrowing activities across various overnight money market segments, driven by considerations of cost and risk, thereby facilitating rate convergence across overnight money market segments. The participants in the call money market include banks and standalone primary dealers (SPDs), both of which not only have access to the Reserve Bank\u2019s LAF but also are under the regulatory purview of the Reserve Bank. In other words, the Reserve Bank has the maximum lever over WACR as compared to any other overnight money market rate. Using the uncollateralised rate as the operating target also has other advantages like it directly influences short-term interest rates and clearly conveys the central bank's stance on liquidity and interest rates. The uncollateralised rate better reflects credit/counterparty risk that is not masked by collateral. Central banks being the sole supplier of reserves have more control over this rate. A stable and predictable uncollateralised rate facilitates a more effective transmission of monetary policy, as it anchors other interest rates across maturities. WACR and rates in the overnight collateralised segments (Triparty Repo and Market Repo) display a high degree of correlation among them and are in close alignment across time horizons. WACR is also found to be effective in transmitting signals to other market rates like treasury bills (T-bills), commercial papers (CPs), certificate of deposits (CDs) and government securities (G-secs) etc. It is equally pertinent to note that while the collateralised market segment accounts for significant portion of the total overnight money market volume, it features a notable presence of non-bank entities such as mutual funds, insurance companies and pension funds, whose transactions in the overnight money market segments do not reflect the dynamics of inter-bank market for reserves and these entities are not regulated by the Reserve Bank. Considering the aforementioned factors, the Group recommends continuation of overnight Weighted Average Call Rate as the operating target. The Reserve Bank may, however, continue to keep track of rates in other overnight segments to ensure orderly evolution of money market rates and smoothen transmission. The Reserve Bank\u2019s LAF consists of SDF, MSF, repo and reverse repo operations."

    "input": "Question: How does the current Liquidity Management Framework (LMF) use a corridor system, and what are the Group's recommendations regarding its continuation?",
    "output": "The LAF under the current LMF is based on the corridor system, with the policy repo rate in the middle of the corridor, the Marginal Standing Facility (MSF) rate (25 basis points above the policy repo rate) as the ceiling, and the Standing Deposit Facility (SDF) rate (25 basis points below the policy repo rate) as the floor. While widening the corridor can encourage relatively higher inter-bank activity, it may lead to increased day-to-day volatility in the short-term market rates. On the other hand, a narrow corridor may provide the advantage of better anchoring of short-term market rates but comes at the cost of reduced incentives for banks to indulge in inter-bank trading. In view of these considerations, the Group recommends continuation of the existing corridor system with the policy repo rate at the middle of the corridor. The corridor would remain symmetric, with the SDF rate and MSF rate, which are 25 basis points away from the policy repo rate, acting as the lower and upper bounds of the corridor, respectively."

    "instruction": "Answer the question based on the provided context from the financial report.",
    "input": "Question: What is recommended regarding VRR/VRRR auctions, transient liquidity management, and communication about repo/reverse repo operations?",
    "output": "The Group recommends that 14-day VRR/VRRR auctions may be discontinued as the main operation. Instead, transient liquidity may be managed primarily through 7-day repo/ reverse repo operations and other operations of tenors from overnight up to 14-days at the discretion of the Reserve Bank based on its assessment of the system liquidity requirement. Further, to reduce uncertainty in the market about the tenor, quantum and timing of the repo/reverse repo operations, the Group felt that it is desirable for the Reserve Bank to provide sufficient advance notice to market participants, at least by one day, while conducting any such liquidity operation. The Group observed that there may be situations in which the evolving liquidity conditions may warrant conduct of liquidity operations on the same day of announcement. The Group recommends that in such circumstances, the Reserve Bank may conduct repo/reverse repo operations announced on the same day. As regards the mechanism for repo and reverse repo operations, the Group noted that the variable rate auctions provide the advantage of better price signaling and consequent efficient allocation of reserves among the market participants. It is viewed that, for liquidity management purpose, variable rate liquidity operations are more appropriate tools than fixed rate operations as the former contains useful market signals about liquidity conditions. In view of the above, the Group recommends continuation of variable rate auction mechanism for conducting repo and reverse repo operations under the LAF. The repo/reverse repo operations of tenor overnight to 14-days are expected to handle the changes in system liquidity due to frictional factors. However, in some scenarios, the liquidity mismatches may extend for a longer term. For handling such liquidity mismatches, the Group recommends that the repo/reverse repo operations of appropriately longer tenor may be conducted through variable rate auctions. The availability of such instruments would provide the necessary liquidity assurance to the market and would also help in minimising frequency and quantum of shorter tenor operations."

    "input": "Question: What are the recommendations regarding Standalone Primary Dealers (SPDs) and averaging of reserve requirements?",
    "output": "Standalone Primary Dealers (SPDs) are heavily dependent on overnight segment of the money market to meet their funding requirements, contributing about three-fourths of the total borrowing in the call money market. SPDs have already been allowed to participate in all repo operations irrespective of tenor with effect from March 26, 2025. The Group also felt that SPDs may not be given access to MSF, as hitherto, as unlike banks they have neither reserve requirements nor unforeseen payment obligations beyond market hours.\n\nRegarding the averaging of reserve requirement, it allows banks to use excess reserves from one day to offset shortfall on other days. In the context of 24x365 payment systems, which has resulted in banks building up precautionary reserve balances, there is a view that some reduction in the 90 per cent daily maintenance requirement is warranted as it may provide further room for banks to effectively manage their liquidity over the maintenance period. However, lowering daily Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) maintenance requirement may induce higher volatility in money market rates, especially during end of fortnights, which may not be desirable. It has also been observed that banks rarely maintain daily reserve balances below 95 per cent of the prescribed CRR. In view of the above, the Group recommends the Reserve Bank to retain the extant daily minimum requirement of 90 per cent of the prescribed CRR."

    "output": "Over the past two decades, the Reserve Bank\u2019s LMF has continuously evolved in response to the changing macroeconomic and financial environment. The LMF of the Reserve Bank has evolved through progressive refinements since 1999 in response to changing domestic conditions and global developments. In April 1999, an Interim LAF was introduced under which liquidity was injected against collateral of GoI securities at various interest rates, but surplus liquidity was absorbed at a fixed rate. The transition from the Interim LAF to a full-fledged LAF took place in June 2000. A new operating framework for monetary policy was implemented in May 2011 to enhance the effectiveness and stability of the monetary system. The framework recommended repo rate as the single policy rate and suggested overnight WACR as the operating target of monetary policy. To manage market liquidity and interest rates effectively, an interest rate corridor of (+/-) 100 basis points (bps) around the repo rate was introduced, with the MSF rate set at 100 bps above the repo rate and the reverse repo rate set at 100 bps below it. The framework aimed to fully accommodate liquidity demand at fixed repo rate, maintaining an indicative comfort zone of (+/-) 1 per cent of the Net Demand and Time Liabilities (NDTL) of the banking system. Additionally, the framework facilitated transmission of changes in repo rate through WACR to the term structure of interest rates, thereby influencing broader financial conditions and economic activities. The LMF was revamped in September 2014 offering banks assured liquidity access equivalent to 1 per cent of their NDTL on an average. It included provisions for overnight fixed-rate repos up to 0.25 per cent of NDTL, while remaining liquidity needs were met through conduct of four 14-day variable rate term repo auctions during the reporting fortnight. Additionally, the introduction of variable rate fine-tuning repo and reverse repo auctions allowed the Reserve Bank to manage liquidity conditions more precisely and respond dynamically to market needs. Further refinements in the LMF were carried out in April 2016 and April 2017. The changes included progressive narrowing of the interest rate corridor around the policy repo rate from (+/) 100 bps to (+/-) 50 bps and further to (+/-) 25 bps to provide more"

    "output": "After April 2016, refinements in the LMF were carried out, including progressive narrowing of the interest rate corridor around the policy repo rate. The framework also aimed to progressively lower the ex-ante system-level liquidity deficit, bringing it closer to a neutral position over the medium term. Additionally, the minimum daily maintenance requirement of the CRR was reduced from 95 per cent to 90 per cent with effect from the fortnight beginning April 16, 2016, granting banks greater flexibility in managing their daily liquidity needs.\n\nIn February 2020, the Reserve Bank announced a revised LMF that retained the liquidity management corridor with WACR as the operating target and retained the corridor width at 50 bps. The main tool for managing transient liquidity was a 14-day term repo/reverse repo operation, aligned with the CRR maintenance cycle, while daily fixed rate repos and fortnightly term repos were withdrawn. Fine-tuning operations supported the main liquidity operation to address any unanticipated liquidity changes. Instruments included fixed rate reverse repo, MSF, variable rate repo/reverse repo auctions, OMOs and FX swaps. The minimum daily CRR maintenance requirement remained at 90 per cent. SPDs were allowed to participate only in overnight liquidity management operations but were not granted access to the MSF. The framework emphasized transparency through dissemination of flow and stock impact of liquidity operations and publication of a quantitative assessment of durable liquidity conditions with a fortnightly lag. SDF, which was operationalised with effect from April 8, 2022, replaced the erstwhile Fixed Rate Reverse Repo (FRRR) as the floor of the LAF corridor. Further, SPDs were allowed to participate in all repo operations irrespective of tenor with effect from March 26, 2025."

    "input": "Question: What are the guiding principles of liquidity management operations, and what is their primary objective?",
    "output": "Liquidity management is the operating procedure of monetary policy, with its primary objective being to ensure that the targeted money market rate remains aligned with the policy rate, focusing on the first step in monetary policy transmission. Liquidity operations are aimed at aligning the target rate to the policy rate to efficiently transmit the policy impulse to overnight market rates, and subsequently to other interest rates in the economy such as term money market rates, G-sec yields, corporate bond yields, and bank deposit and lending rates. In a growing economy like India, while the need for reserves by the banking system tends to increase due to growth in NDTL, liquidity management faces challenges from structural factors like 24x365 payments, volatility in government balances due to \"Just-in-Time\" fund releases, and the Reserve Bank\u2019s forex operations, creating uncertainty about their impact on system liquidity. It is desirable that banking system liquidity should not remain in excessive deficit or surplus for extended periods, as these can cause imbalances such as banks holding funds instead of lending, or create structural constraints like collateral shortages. Durable liquidity operations should be used to bring liquidity back to manageable levels when imbalances occur. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Reserve Bank adopted various liquidity measures to infuse long-term liquidity into the system, resulting in a prolonged period of surplus system liquidity, reaching up to 6 per cent of NDTL (System Liquidity as defined by net borrowing under LAF adjusted for excess reserves maintained by banks)."

    "input": "Question: What are the guiding principles of liquidity management operations?",
    "output": "Liquidity management, as stated in the introduction, is the operating procedure of monetary policy. Its primary objective is to ensure that the targeted money market rate remains aligned to the policy rate. Liquidity management thus focuses on the first step in monetary policy transmission. Liquidity operations are aimed at aligning the target rate to the policy rate. The objective of this transmission of policy impulse to overnight market rates is that further transmission to other interest rates in the economy (term money market rates, G-sec yields, corporate bond yields, bank deposit and lending rates etc.) happens efficiently. If the transmission to overnight rates is incomplete, then the transmission to other market interest rates would also be less than optimal. In a growing economy like India, while the need for reserves by the banking system tends to be on an upward trajectory owing to the secular growth in NDTL, challenges to the liquidity management stem from certain structural factors discussed earlier such as 24x365 payments, increased volatility in government balances considering the introduction of \u201cJust-in-Time\u201d release of funds, the Reserve Bank\u2019s forex operations, etc. Given the nature of these factors, there is a significant degree of uncertainty about their impact on the system liquidity. It is desirable that banking system liquidity should not remain in excessive deficit or surplus for an extended period. Excessive surpluses or deficits give rise to imbalances such as banks holding on to their funds rather than lending in the market or can generate structural constraints like a shortage of collateral in the system. If that happens because of unavoidable reasons, durable liquidity operations should be resorted to, and the liquidity position be brought back to manageable levels. For instance, during the COVID-19 pandemic, in an attempt to ensure normal functioning of the financial markets, various liquidity measures were adopted by the Reserve Bank to infuse long-term liquidity into the system. These extraordinary liquidity measures resulted in a prolonged period of surplus system liquidity, reaching up to 6 percent of NDTL of the banking system. Subsequently, surplus liquidity infused into the system was gradually withdrawn over time while ensuring there was no major impact on financial markets. The effectiveness of the LMF is premised on the existence of an active overnight money market. The LMF should incentivize banks to trade among themselves rather than with the central bank because the transmission process crucially depends on market forces working efficiently. That is, it should address the shortage or excess liquidity at the system level, not that of individual entities, as the latter would effectively mean that the Reserve Bank is acting as a market maker. The LMF should also facilitate the development of money markets so as to achieve efficient transmission of monetary policy. Selecting an appropriate design of the LMF and defining an appropriate target rate are crucial for monetary policy operations to achieve its objective. Broadly two types of LMFs are prevalent globally, viz., a corridor system and a floor system. In a corridor system, the central bank maintains standing facilities on either side of the corridor viz., a deposit facility wherein participants can deposit their excess reserves at the end of the day and a lending facility wherefrom participants can borrow reserves in times of need. Therefore, the deposit rate and the lending rate under the standing facilities effectively become the floor and the ceiling of the corridor respectively, with the policy rate in between. The central bank modulates the quantum of available liquidity in the system to keep the overnight rates within the corridor and aligned to the policy rate. On the other hand, in a floor system, the central bank is required to maintain only a deposit facility to act as the floor and the policy rate is defined at the floor rate. By supplying abundant liquidity, the central bank can maintain the overnight rates at the deposit rate thereby aligning the market rates to the policy rate. With regard to the operating target, the choice should be based on \u201cfirst principles\u201d of liquidity management rather than being determined by the phase of the liquidity cycle (easy vis-\u00e0-vis tight) or convenience of market participants. As the central bank supplies reserves through the LMF, the target rate should preferably be."

    "input": "Question: What are the mechanics of the Reserve Bank of India's Liquidity Management Framework (LMF) and how does it ensure the target rate is aligned to the policy repo rate?",
    "output": "In the Indian context, the Reserve Bank\u2019s LMF is currently a corridor system with WACR as the target rate. The mechanics of the LMF that ensure that the target rate is aligned to the policy repo rate in the Indian context is as follows: The first step in achieving this objective is to define upper and lower limits within which the target rate is to be kept. Liquidity operations then need to ensure that the target rate remains within the policy corridor. At the lower end of the corridor is the floor rate \u2013 the rate at which the Reserve Bank absorbs surplus funds from the banking system, currently the SDF rate which replaced the FRRR with effect from April 8, 2022. At the upper end of the corridor is the ceiling rate - the rate at which the Reserve Bank assures provision of funds to the banking system, currently the MSF rate. The target rate, which is a market determined rate, is contained within the corridor by assuring the banking system that, (a) if the system is in liquidity deficit, the Reserve Bank shall meet the deficit up to a certain limit, at the ceiling rate and (b) if the system is in liquidity surplus, the Reserve Bank shall absorb the surplus at the floor rate. This assurance ensures that no market participant would lend in the money market below the floor rate or borrow in the money market above the ceiling rate. Subject to participants not being constrained by their ability to tap MSF, the policy corridor serves the purpose of constraining volatility in the targeted money market segment rate within the width of the corridor, currently 50 bps. Having ensured that the target rate is contained within the policy corridor, the next step is to align it to the policy rate. A simple method is to provide market participants incentive to transact amongst each other, while conducting appropriate liquidity operations to maintain adequate liquidity at the systemic level. As long as there is an assurance from the Reserve Bank of provision of liquidity as per the conditions, the target rate should be from a market that trades in reserves and should have a strong correlation to the other segments of the money market and one that influences the benchmark rates. Further, all the participants in the target money market should have access to the central bank\u2019s liquidity facilities (LAF in the case of the Reserve Bank) so that the effect of monetary policy actions can be transmitted seamlessly."

    "output": "Certainty of liquidity management operations in a broad sense and provision of required liquidity to the banking system by the Reserve Bank are the key principles of the LMF. Clear communication aimed at increasing certainty about liquidity conditions and providing assurance to market participants, should be an underlying factor in the design of the LMF. Further, minimizing the number of operations to bring in more clarity about the conduct of liquidity operations would also be an important factor in improving the efficiency of monetary policy transmission. The alignment of the target rate to the policy repo rate is achieved by the Reserve Bank assuring the banking system that if the system is in liquidity deficit, the Reserve Bank shall meet the deficit up to a certain limit, at the ceiling rate and if the system is in liquidity surplus, the Reserve Bank shall absorb the surplus at the floor rate. This assurance ensures that no market participant would lend in the money market below the floor rate or borrow in the money market above the ceiling rate. Subject to participants not being constrained by their ability to tap MSF, the policy corridor serves the purpose of constraining volatility in the targeted money market segment rate within the width of the corridor, currently 50 bps. As long as there is an assurance from the Reserve Bank of provision of liquidity as per the systemic needs, there is very little incentive for any bank in the system to borrow at significantly higher rates in the market. In other words, the target rate will not deviate significantly from the policy repo rate. Thus, the objective of LMF will be achieved."

    "output": "Drawing insights from the experience gained during the tenure of the current LMF and developments in the money market, this chapter presents an analytical review of various issues of the current LMF and suggests recommendations wherever required. Under the existing LMF, the Weighted Average Call Rate (WACR) is the operating target of monetary policy. The objective of liquidity management operations is to align the target rate to the policy repo rate. Pursuant to the recommendation of the \u201cWorking group on Operating Procedure of Monetary Policy\u201d (Chairman: Deepak Mohanty, RBI, 2011), the WACR was recommended to be the operating target of monetary policy of the Reserve Bank. Since then, the LMF has undergone major changes in 2014 and 2020, however, WACR has continued to remain the operating target. Since 2011, volumes in call money market, which is uncollateralised, have reduced from 16 per cent to about 2 per cent of total overnight money market volumes during 2022-2025. This change indicates a shift in liquidity management preference of market participants towards collateralised borrowing/lending aided by regulatory policies. The participation base in call money market has also changed with the share of scheduled commercial banks reducing over time accompanied by a significant increase in the share of SPDs. Domestically, this shift in the trends has been influenced by increasing participation of non-bank lenders (especially mutual funds) in secured overnight money markets. Regulatory changes have also left banks with a larger holding of excess Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) securities which can be used to meet their funding needs in collateralised market, with lower associated capital and other regulatory costs. It may, however, be noted that shift in money market volumes towards collateralised segments is a universal phenomenon during the post-Global Financial Crisis era. Despite this, most central banks continue to have unsecured inter-bank rate as their operating target. Only four major central banks (Canada, Brazil, Mexico, and Switzerland) have shifted to overnight secured rate (repo) as the operating target."

    "output": "For the central bank\u2019s liquidity management operations to be effective, there are broadly two considerations regarding the operating target:\n(a) entities that are active in the target money market segment, must also have access to the central bank\u2019s liquidity facilities (LAF in the case of the Reserve Bank).\n(b) entities that access these facilities, do onward lending or borrowing driven by cost and risk considerations for rates to equilibrate among different overnight money market segments. Consideration (a) is imperative to ensure that rates in the overnight money market segment reflect, to the extent possible, the impact of central bank\u2019s operations. The operating target should be the one which the monetary authority can effectively control, allowing it to achieve its broader objectives. The participants in the call money market in India include banks and SPDs, both of which are regulated by the Reserve Bank and have access to the LAF. Therefore, the Reserve Bank has the maximum lever over WACR as compared to any other overnight money market rate."

    "output": "The rationale for using the uncollateralised rate as the operating target stems from its ability to directly influence short-term interest rates and provide a clear signal of the central bank's stance on liquidity and interest rates. This approach has several advantages, viz., (i) the uncollateralised rate provides a better assessment of credit/counterparty risk that is not masked by collateral; (ii) central banks have more control over the uncollateralised overnight rate as they are the sole supplier of bank reserves; (iii) targeting the uncollateralised rate provides a clear signal to financial markets about the central banks\u2019 desired level of interest rates; (iv) a stable and predictable uncollateralised rate facilitates a more effective transmission of monetary policy since all other rates across the term structure are priced off the uncollateralised rate; and (v) communicating policy changes through the uncollateralised rate are less prone to misinterpretations. Overall, the uncollateralised rate serves as a readily observable indicator of the effectiveness of monetary policy and provides a mechanism for the central bank to guide market participants' expectations about future interest rate movements."

The high correlation between WACR and collateralised rates (Chart V.2 and Chart V.3) suggests that signals from the former are effectively transmitted to secured overnight rates.

The Reserve Bank may, however, continue to keep track of rates in other overnight segments to ensure orderly evolution of money market rates and smoothen transmission. Accordingly, the Reserve Bank\u2019s liquidity management operations may take into account movement in secured rates to ensure better alignment of overnight rates with the policy repo rate.

    "input": "Question: How does the LAF operate under the current Liquidity Management Framework (LMF), and what are the implications of corridor width?",
    "output": "The LAF under the current LMF is based on the corridor system, with the policy repo rate in the middle of the corridor. The MSF rate acts as the ceiling (25 bps above the policy repo rate) while the SDF rate acts as the floor (25 bps below the policy repo rate) of the corridor. Reducing the volatility in the inter-bank money market rate while achieving the interest rate target is both an objective and a challenge for efficient liquidity management. Widening the corridor can encourage relatively higher inter-bank activity as the opportunity cost of holding excess reserves or being short of required reserves is higher, thereby nudging banks to manage their liquidity pro-actively. However, a wider corridor may lead to increased day-to-day volatility in the short-term market rates, which may also impart volatility to the longer end of the term structure of interest rates. On the other hand, a narrow corridor may provide the advantage of better anchoring of short-term market rates but comes at the cost of reduced incentives for banks to indulge in inter-bank trading. A comparison of LMFs of countries operating under the corridor system suggests that corridors are typically wider in most emerging markets while the advanced countries tend to have narrow corridors (Annex). As emerging countries are often more susceptible to large capital flow shocks, a wider corridor system is more suitable for them as it offers the desired flexibility to operate the LMF both in conditions of liquidity deficit and surplus. However, a wider corridor entails more volatility in money-market rates. Among advanced economies, the European Central Bank (ECB), the Bank of Canada (BoC), the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ), and the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) were the pioneers of the symmetric corridor system around the year 2000. The Norges Bank implemented monetary policy through a relatively pure version of a floor system until October 2011; thereafter, it shifted to a quota-based system \u2013 a compromise between a floor system and a corridor system. Central banks like the BoC and the RBNZ adopted the floor system in 2020."

    "output": "Recently, the Bank of England (BoE), the Bank of Canada (BoC), the European Central Bank (ECB), and the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) have all announced plans to reduce reserves until borrowing from the central bank picks up and market rates are marginally above the interest rate paid by the central bank on deposits, essentially returning to a corridor system. This new \u2018soft\u2019 floor framework with a narrower spread can be characterised as a hybrid system, combining the smallest possible central bank balance sheet with both structural and fine-tuning operations. Its main objective is to allow for effective control of short-term money market rates in transition from a situation of abundant excess liquidity to one of less ample liquidity.\n\nThe global shift towards reducing corridor width reflects central banks' efforts to refine liquidity management and enhance monetary policy transmission. The ECB announced a new operational framework, effective September 2024, aimed at transitioning from excess to less ample liquidity. Under this framework, the main refinancing operations (MRO) rate was positioned 15 bps above the floor i.e., deposit facility rate (DFR), instead of 50 bps prior to this new framework. The marginal lending facility (MLF) rate which acts as the ceiling continued to remain 25 bps above the MRO rate. This adjustment effectively narrowed the corridor width from 75 bps to 40 bps, helping to anchor market rates closer to the DFR and mitigate liquidity-driven volatility.\n\nSimilarly, the RBA announced in April 2024 its shift from an excess reserves system to an ample reserves framework. According to the RBA, the move towards ample reserves, which lies somewhere between the prevailing \u2018floor\u2019 system with excess reserves and the pre-pandemic \u2018corridor\u2019 system with scarce reserves, eliminates the need for precise reserve estimations and reduces money market fluctuations.\n\nIn the Indian context, the LAF interest rate corridor was symmetric with a width of 200 bps at its inception in May 2011 and continued to be so till mid-July 2013. Consequent to the volatility wrought by the taper tantrum on domestic financial markets, the Reserve Bank widened the corridor asymmetrically to 400 bps in mid-July 2013 (with the ceiling 300 bps above the policy rate and the floor 100 bps below the policy rate). With the return of normalcy, the corridor width was gradually restored to its pre-crisis level by end-October 2013. Subsequently, the corridor was narrowed from 200 bps to 100 bps in April 2016 and further to 50 bps in April 2017."

    "output": "Following the financial market dislocations consequent to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the LAF interest rate corridor in the Indian context was asymmetrically widened to 90 bps in two stages with the FRRR rate 65 bps below and the MSF rate 25 bps above the policy repo rate, respectively. The width was restored to 50 bps after the introduction of the SDF at 25 bps below the policy repo rate on April 8, 2022, which reinstated the symmetricity of the corridor. Corroborating the experience of the euro area, volatility of the inter-bank overnight uncollateralised call rate \u2013 as measured by the exponential weighted moving average (EWMA) of the WACR \u2013 moderated with the progressive narrowing of the corridor."

    "input": "Question: What is one factor contributing towards higher amounts parked under the SDF, and what measure was implemented to address this?",
    "output": "One factor contributing towards higher amounts parked under the SDF is the tendency of banks to maintain precautionary balances to meet any unforeseen payment obligations arising beyond market hours due to the availability of payment systems on a 24x365 basis. Any excess amount after meeting payment obligations is then parked under the SDF. This behavior was exacerbated because there was no funding avenue for banks as the money market used to close at 5:00 PM. The extension of timings of the call money market up to 7:00 pm with effect from July 1, 2025, based on the recommendation of \u201cReport of the Working Group on Comprehensive Review of Trading and Settlement Timings of Markets Regulated by the Reserve Bank\u201d (Chairman: Shri Radha Shyam Ratho, RBI, 2025), would help in reducing banks\u2019 precautionary demand for reserves to meet any unforeseen payment obligations."

    "input": "Question: What are the characteristics of the variable rate liquidity operations conducted by the Reserve Bank, and what do the bid-to-cover ratios indicate about bank participation in VRR and VRRR auctions?",
    "output": "In the extant Liquidity Management Framework (LMF), the 14-day Variable Rate Repo/Reverse Repo (VRR/VRRR) auction, which coincides with CRR maintenance cycle, is the main liquidity operation to handle transient liquidity. Additionally, fine-tuning operations which include VRR/VRRR operations of tenors overnight to 13 days, conducted at the discretion of the Reserve Bank, provide the flexibility to handle liquidity mismatches that may occur during the 14-day period. An analysis of the bid-to-cover ratios of variable rate liquidity operations conducted over the past two years shows a stark difference in participation of banks in the VRR and VRRR main operations. During the calendar year 2024, the Reserve Bank conducted 25 main operations (14 VRR and 11 VRRR operations) and 147 fine-tuning operations (56 VRR and 91 VRRR). While VRR auctions (both main and fine-tuning) were generally over-subscribed, indicating preference of banks for any additional liquidity from the Reserve Bank, the VRRR auctions generally saw lower participation from banks. Further analysis of the bid-to-cover ratios of VRRR operations shows that VRRR main operations saw muted response from banks with the average bid-to-cover ratio of only 0.18 during the calendar year 2024. On the other hand, comparatively higher average bid-to-cover ratios in VRRR fine-tuning operations and large SDF balances were observed over the period of VRRR main operations. This shows a clear preference of banks to deposit their excess reserves with the Reserve Bank for overnight/shorter tenors rather than participating actively in the 14-day main operation, despite holding excess reserves over the period of the main operation, thus foregoing a spread of up to 24 bps in the process. The major reason for lower participation of banks in VRRR main auctions is the limited information that banks have on the frictional factors like changes in GoI cash balances, because of which they are unable to forecast liquidity for 14 days. This marked reluctance of banks to part with surplus liquidity for longer tenors was also one of the reasons that the Reserve Bank had to conduct a relatively higher number of fine-tuning VRRR operations to absorb excess liquidity from the system."

    "input": "Question: According to the RBI, how do a large number of fine-tuning operations impact the Reserve Bank's liquidity operations, and what uncertainties arise from these operations?",
    "output": "A large number of fine-tuning operations, in general, increase the uncertainty about the Reserve Bank\u2019s liquidity operations. Further, as fine-tuning operations are conducted at the discretion of the Reserve Bank, there is uncertainty in the market about the quantum and timing of operations. Consequently, it is observed that when fine-tuning operations were announced at a short notice i.e., on the same day of the operation, the short-term market rates adjusted to ex-ante liquidity conditions without reference to Chart V.7 and Chart V.8."

    "instruction": "Answer the question based on the provided context from the financial report.",
    "input": "Question: How did banks participate in VRR auctions, and what factors influenced their choices between daily and 14-day VRR main operations?",
    "output": "Higher average bid-to-cover ratios observed in both main and fine-tuning VRR auctions conducted during the last two calendar years indicate that banks actively participated in these auctions, irrespective of tenors (Chart V.7). The bid-to-cover ratio in VRR auctions inter-alia depends on the total notified amount of auctions vis-\u00e0-vis the prevailing liquidity conditions. For instance, a VRR auction with a significantly lower (higher) notified amount than the actual liquidity requirement of the banking system may result into a higher (lower) bid-to-cover ratio. From an analysis of VRR auctions conducted during the period January 16, 2025 to March 31, 2025, when the system liquidity was largely in deficit, daily VRR auctions saw higher participation than the 14-day VRR main operations. While the average bid-to-cover ratio for daily VRR operations conducted during the said period was 0.80, it was 0.55 for VRR main operations. Banks\u2019 preference to borrow funds in daily VRRs over 14-day VRR main operations can be attributed to frictional factors discussed earlier, which make it difficult for them to forecast liquidity over 14-day period. According to paragraph V.28, the major reason for lower participation of banks in VRRR main auctions is the limited information that banks have on the frictional factors like changes in GoI cash balances, because of which they are unable to forecast liquidity for 14 days."

    "instruction": "Answer the question based on the provided context from the financial report.",
    "input": "Question: What recommendations did the Group make regarding liquidity management operations, advance notice, and variable or fixed rate operations?",
    "output": "The Group recommends discontinuing 14-day VRR/VRRR auctions as the main operation and managing transient liquidity primarily through 7-day repo/reverse repo operations, as well as other operations with tenors from overnight up to 14 days at the discretion of the Reserve Bank based on its assessment of the system liquidity requirement. To reduce market uncertainty, the Group felt it desirable for the Reserve Bank to provide sufficient advance notice to market participants, at least one day in advance, before conducting such operations, noting the implementation of a standard time window from 9:30 AM to 10:00 AM for pre-announced operations. In situations where evolving liquidity conditions warrant it, the Group recommends that the Reserve Bank may conduct repo/reverse repo operations announced on the same day. Liquidity management operations are generally conducted either at a fixed-rate on full-allotment basis or through variable rate auctions for a specific quantum decided by the central bank. In the case of fixed-rate full allotment-based liquidity operations, liquidity operations of a particular day would be determined by requirement of each bank, while variable rate auctions allow the central bank to conduct liquidity operations based on its assessment of the system liquidity."

    "instruction": "Answer the question based on the provided context from the financial report.",
    "input": "Question: What are the benefits of variable rate auctions and what is the recommendation of the group regarding its use for repo and reverse repo operations under the LAF?",
    "output": "Fixed-rate full allotment basis has moral hazard issues and would also adversely impact the inter-bank activity in the overnight segment. Although the LAF operations are not meant for price discovery, bids received in variable rate auctions can be a good signal for assessing the true extent of funds required from (to be deployed with) the central bank. Moreover, variable rate auctions provide the central bank enough flexibility to decide on auction cut-offs and the amount which would make liquidity management more nimble and agile rather than being constrained by the fixed rate. In view of the above, the Group recommends continuation of variable rate auction mechanism for conducting repo and reverse repo operations under the LAF. As liquidity provided or absorbed would be based on requirement of the entire banking system rather than that of individual banks, it is likely to encourage inter-bank activity during the tenor of the auction."

    "input": "Question: What are the roles, access to liquidity facilities, and limitations faced by Standalone Primary Dealers (SPDs) in the context of Reserve Bank's liquidity management operations?",
    "output": "Standalone Primary Dealers (SPDs) are highly leveraged institutions that depend on the overnight segment of the money market for funding. Given that the Weighted Average Call Rate (WACR) is the operating target of monetary policy, it's essential for all call money market members to have access to the Reserve Bank\u2019s liquidity facilities for effective monetary policy transmission; SPDs are the largest borrowers in this market, contributing about three-fourths of total borrowing.\n\nSPDs play an important role in the primary and secondary markets for Government securities. They are allowed to participate directly in all overnight liquidity management operations, except the Marginal Standing Facility (MSF). They also have access to the Standing Liquidity Facility (SLF) to borrow funds from the Reserve Bank against eligible Government securities at the policy repo rate, repayable within 90 days. Since March 2025, they've been granted access to all repo operations regardless of tenor.\n\nWhile SPDs can participate in all repo operations, their limited stock of free Government securities restricts their participation in overnight repo auctions, especially when these are not announced in advance. The uncertainty regarding the timing and quantum of overnight variable rate auctions, which are based on evolving liquidity conditions, further complicates their participation. Advance notice of Reserve Bank operations would improve their participation in Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) operations.\n\nThe MSF is available to banks to meet unanticipated shortfalls in their daily cash reserve requirements. With Real-Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) and National Electronic Funds Transfer (NEFT) systems available 24x365, banks may have unforeseen payment obligations beyond market hours. However, the Group does not see any unforeseen liquidity requirements for SPDs after the close of market, and any emergency liquidity needs can be met in the extended call market timings (effective July 1, 2025). Therefore, there is no perceived need to extend MSF or provide a similar overnight emergency funding facility to SPDs."

    "instruction": "Answer the question based on the provided context from the financial report.",
    "input": "Question: What is the purpose of averaging the reserve requirement, and how has the daily minimum reserve requirement in India changed over time?",
    "output": "Mandatory reserve requirements in the form of CRR and payments system obligations are major determinants for demand for reserves on any particular day. The averaging of the reserve requirement over the maintenance period allows banks to use excess reserves from one day to offset shortfalls on other days. In India, the daily minimum reserve requirement was prescribed to provide flexibility to banks in choosing an optimum strategy of holding reserves depending upon their intra-fortnight cash flows. Within the reporting fortnight, banks flexibly optimize their daily maintenance levels based on a cost-benefit analysis of interest rate expectations vis-\u00e0-vis rates on standing facilities. The daily minimum reserve requirement was enhanced from 70 per cent of NDTL (effective since December 2002) to 99 per cent in July 2013 but subsequently reduced to 95 per cent in September 2013 and further to 90 per cent in April 2016. During the COVID-19 pandemic, it was lowered to 80 per cent in March 2020 in view of hardships faced by banks due to social distancing of staff and consequent strain on reporting requirements but subsequently reverted to 90 per cent by September 2020. A very high daily minimum requirement constrains the flexibility of banks during the reserve maintenance period."

    "instruction": "Answer the question based on the provided context from the financial report.",
    "input": "Question: What are the arguments for and against reducing the daily maintenance requirement of 90 percent for the prescribed CRR, and what is the group's recommendation?",
    "output": "Empirical evidence shows that banks build precautionary reserve balances to honor payment obligations of 24x365 payment systems in India, which may have pushed neutral system liquidity higher. In this connection, there is a view that some reduction in the 90 per cent daily maintenance requirement is warranted as it may provide further room for banks to effectively manage their liquidity over the maintenance period. However, on the flip side, reducing the minimum daily balance requirement from the extant 90 per cent may induce larger volatility in WACR, especially at the end of fortnights. Increased volatility in the operating target adversely affects the smooth transmission of monetary policy. The resultant increased variability in the daily CRR maintenance of individual banks may also pose challenges to the Reserve Bank\u2019s liquidity forecasting. It has also been observed that banks rarely maintain daily reserve balances below 95 per cent of the prescribed CRR. Thus, the extant 90 per cent requirement is not a binding constraint on banks. The Group recognises that the present minimum requirement of maintaining 90 per cent of the prescribed CRR on a daily basis has helped avoid bunching of reserve requirement by individual banks. Accordingly, the Group recommends the Reserve Bank to retain the extant daily minimum requirement of 90 per cent of the prescribed CRR."

The feedback will inform the RBI's regulatory and supervisory approach.\n\nKey observations from the survey included:\n\nBoard-level engagement and responsibility: Board-level engagement on climate risk and sustainable finance is inadequate. \nStrategy: A majority of the banks did not have a separate business unit or vertical for sustainability and ESG-related initiatives.\nRisk management: Almost all the surveyed banks recognized the urgency of the issue, and most of them considered climate-related financial risks to be a material threat to their business. Physical and transition risks were seen as the main sources of climate-related risks.\nTransition to low-carbon exposure: Most of the surveyed banks have decided to gradually reduce their exposure to high-carbon emitting/polluting businesses in the coming years."

Most banks are looking at capacity building to better understand the financial implications of climate risk. Further, most banks felt that the available data was insufficient for an appropriate assessment of climate-related financial risks and the processes and methodologies to measure and monitor climate-related financial risks were also not sufficiently developed.\nBanks need to put in place a mechanism at either the Board or top management level for overseeing and scaling up initiatives relating to climate risk and sustainability. They could consider including KPIs on climate risk, sustainability and ESG as a part of the performance evaluation of their top management. Banks need to fully grasp the physical, transition and liability risks associated with climate risk and also actively start managing them to make their loan and investment portfolios more resilient to such risks. Further, banks need to develop a strategy for managing climate risk and integrating it into their risk management framework. Banks need to align their climate-related financial disclosures with an internationally accepted framework to improve the comparability and consistency of the disclosures with their counterparts globally.

    "input": "Question: What is the introduction to the survey on climate risk and sustainable finance, and what role does the RBI play in managing these risks?",
    "output": "Climate risk and sustainable finance has caught the attention of regulators, national authorities and supra-national authorities across the world. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Report of August 2021 highlighted the changes being observed in the Earth\u2019s climate in every region across the whole climate system. The Report states that emissions of greenhouse gases from human activities are responsible for approximately 1.1\u00b0C warming since 1850-1900, and finds that, averaged over the next 20 years, global temperature is expected to reach or exceed 1.5\u00b0C warming. Subsequently, the recent Conference of the Parties (COP26) Summit held at Glasgow in November 2021 saw several countries committing to wide-ranging climate action. The recent IPCC Report and the COP26 Summit have, therefore, enhanced the focus on climate change.\n\nIn order to learn from and contribute to the global effort towards enhancing the role of the financial system to manage risks, and in the broader context of environmentally sustainable development, the RBI joined the Central Banks and Supervisors Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) as a member in April 2021. Further, the RBI is also represented in the G20 Sustainable Finance Working Group, Financial Stability Board\u2019s Working Group on Climate Risk and Work Stream on Climate-related Disclosures, Task Force on Climate-related Financial Risks set up by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) and the International Platform on Sustainable Finance. \n\nIn May 2021, the RBI set up a SFG within its DoR to lead the efforts and regulatory initiatives in the area of climate risk and sustainable finance. The SFG would be instrumental in suggesting strategies and evolving a regulatory framework, including appropriate disclosures, which could be prescribed for banks and other regulated entities (REs) to propagate sustainable practices and mitigate climate-related risks in the Indian context. \n\nIn order to assess the progress of the regulated entities in managing climate risk, the RBI is coming out with a consultative discussion paper (DP) covering aspects such as (i) governance (ii) strategy (iii) risk management, and (iv) disclosure. Based on feedback from stakeholders and leveraging on the work being done by the NGFS and international standard setting bodies like the BCBS, FSB, etc., RBI would propose appropriate guidelines in this regard. \n\nThe financial sector plays a key role in facilitating the massive reallocation of resources required for the economic transformation. Given the important role played by banks in intermediation and resource allocation across the economy, their strategic decisions would be a key factor in the transition to a sustainable economy. A primary role of the SFG would be to suggest strategies that could be adopted."

    "output": "The Reserve Bank of India's Sustainable Finance Group (SFG) conducted a survey among leading banks to understand the prevalent practices and initiatives taken by these banks in the area of climate risk and sustainable finance. The objective of the survey was to assess the approach of these banks, their level of preparedness, etc., with respect to climate risk and sustainable finance. Leading central banks and supervisors in other jurisdictions have also conducted such surveys to fine-tune their regulatory and supervisory approach with respect to climate risk and sustainable finance. In line with these efforts, the SFG conducted a short and focused survey among leading scheduled commercial banks in India. The feedback from this exercise will help in shaping the regulatory and supervisory approach of the RBI to climate risk and sustainable finance."

    "output": "The survey, conducted in early January 2022, was sent to 34 scheduled commercial banks, including public sector, private sector, and foreign banks with a significant presence in India, and they were given three weeks to respond. The feedback offered a thorough overview of their strategy, risk management, and degree of preparedness pertaining to climate risk and sustainable finance. The survey consisted of 30 questions covering risk management, governance, climate-related financial disclosures, opportunities from transition to a green future, HR and capacity building, and green initiatives. Except for two questions, all questions were multiple choice, and participants were asked to elaborate on their chosen response for 27 of the 30 questions. An explanatory note was provided to help banks complete the questionnaire. All participating banks submitted timely and comprehensive responses, despite disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in January 2022."

Against this backdrop, the questions put to the respondents were designed to gauge the status of climate risk in their current risk management framework. Key observations from a risk management perspective include that two out of three banks considered climate-related financial risks as a material threat to their business, including all the surveyed foreign banks. However, four out of twelve public sector banks and seven out of sixteen private sector banks were yet to consider climate-related financial risks as a material threat to their business."

    "input": "Question: What are the potential sources of climate-related risks to a bank, and how are banks handling potential physical and transition risks, according to the Reserve Bank of India survey?",
    "output": "According to the 'Report of the Survey on Climate Risk and Sustainable Finance' conducted by the Reserve Bank of India, physical risks, transition risks, and liability risks could be the sources of climate-related risks to a bank.\n\nPhysical risks refer to the economic costs and financial losses resulting from the increasing severity and frequency of:\n\n\u2022\tExtreme climate change-related weather events (or extreme weather events) such as heatwaves, landslides, floods, wildfires, and storms (i.e., acute physical risks);\n\u2022\tLonger-term gradual shifts in climate such as changes in precipitation, extreme weather variability, ocean acidification, and rising sea levels and average temperatures (i.e., chronic physical risks or chronic risks); and\n\u2022\tIndirect effects of climate change such as loss of ecosystem services (e.g., desertification, water shortage, degradation of soil quality or marine ecology).\n\nTransition risks are the risks related to the process of adjustment towards a low-carbon economy.\n\nLiability risks are the risks arising from people or businesses seeking compensation for losses suffered from physical and transition risks.\n\nThe survey showed that:\n\n\u2022\tA vast majority of banks considered both physical and transition risks as sources of climate-related risks.\n\u2022\tAll the surveyed foreign banks considered physical and transition risks as sources of climate-related risks. Nine out of 12 public sector banks and 14 out of 16 private sector banks also gave the same feedback.\n\nRegarding how banks are handling potential physical and transition risks, all the surveyed foreign banks and some of the private sector banks said that they handled potential physical and transition risks by integrating them into their risk management framework. Some of the public sector banks said that they factored the physical and transition risks into their Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) but were yet to integrate climate-related risks into their overall risk management framework."

Almost all the surveyed foreign banks said that they recognized the potential liability risks arising from climate change into their risk assessment framework. Public sector and private sector banks could also consider factoring in the potential liability risks arising from climate change into their risk assessment framework.\nBanks should urgently identify the processes, methodologies and tools they will need to effectively manage climate risk. This entails embedding climate factors into their risk management framework. Most of the surveyed foreign banks said that they have put in place an internal strategy to integrate climate risk into their risk management framework. On the other hand, 2 out of 12 public sector banks and 4 out of 16 private sector banks said that they have put in place an internal strategy for managing climate risk and integrating it into their risk management framework."

This requires greater attention at the Board level in public sector banks in particular and also in some of the private sector banks.\n- Public and private sector banks could have a mechanism in place at the Board or top management level for overseeing their climate and sustainability-related initiatives and scaling them up.\n\nClimate-Related Financial Disclosures:\n- Foreign banks have aligned their climate-related financial disclosures with the recommendations of the TCFD framework. Public and private sector banks may consider making their climate-related financial disclosures in line with a widely accepted international framework, to improve the consistency and comparability of such disclosures with their counterparts globally.\n- Banks are beginning to enhance their external communication on sustainability, ESG or climate risk through their websites for single-point information dissemination. All the surveyed foreign banks and some private sector banks had a separate webpage for this purpose.\n\nOpportunities from Transition to a Green Future:\n- Public sector, private sector and foreign banks have stated that undertaking green financing would require structural changes in their current lending and investing approach. This would help them to better evaluate the green credentials of their potential lending and investment decisions thereby supporting corporate borrowers in their transition to net-zero.\n- All the surveyed foreign banks and select private sector banks have either mobilized new capital to scale up green lending and investment or set a target for incremental lending and investment for sustainable finance.\n- All the surveyed foreign banks are looking to reduce their exposure to high-carbon emitting/polluting businesses. Public and private sector banks could adopt a gradual and non-disruptive approach to transition away from such businesses, keeping in mind the development imperatives of a growing economy like India.\n- Most of the surveyed foreign banks have a dedicated department or business vertical for sustainable finance to tap the growing business opportunities in this segment."

Foreign banks have initiated discussions with their corporate borrowers on reducing emissions. Public sector and private sector banks could also look at suitable initiatives to help their corporate borrowers transition to net-zero emissions. Foreign banks have been investing significantly in capacity building of staff on climate risk and sustainable finance issues. Public and private sector banks could also scale up their sustainable finance business, integrate climate risks into their risk management framework, incorporate ESG principles in their business, etc. Foreign banks are adequately staffed with dedicated teams working on climate risk, sustainable finance and ESG-related initiatives. Public and private sector banks could do the same so as to better manage climate risk and tap the opportunities arising from sustainable finance and ESG. All the surveyed foreign banks and most private sector banks have developed an ESG strategy. Public sector banks and the remaining private sector banks could do the same.

    "output": "The Survey on Climate Risk and Sustainable Finance aims to assess the approach, practices, and preparedness of banks with respect to climate risk and sustainable finance. Climate change is generating more frequent and extreme weather events, which will significantly weaken local economic activity and lead to the erosion of asset values. As intermediaries and providers of capital, banks play a crucial role in the economic development of our country that now includes managing climate-related financial risks. Central banks are, therefore, urging their respective financial institutions to quickly implement internal arrangements required to monitor and mitigate such risks. Leading central banks in several jurisdictions have conducted similar surveys to get a much better picture with regard to climate risk management and sustainable finance in their regulated entities and the feedback from such surveys have helped them fine-tune their regulatory and supervisory approach, scale up capacity-building measures, etc., with respect to climate risk and sustainable finance. The Sustainable Finance Group in the Department of Regulation, Reserve Bank of India, Central Office planned a short, focused survey among the public sector banks, private sector banks and leading foreign banks. The survey was open from Monday, January 3, 2022 to Friday, January 21, 2022, and banks were requested to ensure that they answered all the questions, providing as much information as possible where elaboration was requested. For any clarifications, banks could contact Shri. Brij Raj, General Manager, Sustainable Finance Group, Department of Regulation, Reserve Bank of India, Central Office, Mumbai."

    "output": "Market trading hours are critical for the efficient functioning of financial markets, as they influence liquidity, volatility, and facilitate price discovery by ensuring timely incorporation of information into asset prices. The last comprehensive review of market timings, for financial markets regulated by the Reserve Bank viz., the Government securities market, the money markets, the foreign exchange market and the markets for derivatives on interest rate, foreign exchange and credit, was undertaken in 2019.\nOver the last few years, there have been significant developments in these markets. For instance, the size of different domestic markets has increased significantly. The number of participants in different markets has also increased as has the diversity of products. Non-resident participation in Indian derivative markets has increased pursuant to regulatory changes facilitating such participation while such participation has also increased in the Government securities market post inclusion of Government securities in global bond indices. The participation of Indian entities in Non-Deliverable Forwards (NDFs) and Foreign Currency Settled - Overnight Indexed Swaps (FCS-OIS) has enabled greater integration of the onshore and offshore markets. Market infrastructure has also evolved with wider access to Electronic Trading Platforms (ETPs) and central counterparty (CCP) clearing services. Liquidity management dynamics have changed, amidst availability of 24x7 payment systems and evolution of the Reserve Bank\u2019s Liquidity Management Framework (LMF).\nAgainst this backdrop, it was announced, in the Statement on Developmental and Regulatory Policies dated February 07, 2025, that a Working Group (hereinafter \u2018the Group\u2019) will be set up to review the current market trading and settlement timings and make recommendations in this regard. In accordance with the Terms of Reference (ToR), the Group has provided recommendations which are aimed at facilitating further market development, price discovery and optimization of liquidity requirements. \nThe first chapter of the report outlines the current trading and settlement timings of the domestic markets and the Reserve Bank\u2019s liquidity facilities. It also discusses the evolution of markets in terms of size, participation and infrastructure, along with changes in payment systems which have necessitated a review of the trading and settlement timings.\nThe second chapter provides an overview of the recent developments in market microstructure. It observes that, in general, there has been an increase in turnover and open interest across the various market segments. This has been complemented by a rise in electronic trading and central clearing. The investor / participation base has also diversified with increased participation from both domestic and non-resident investors.\nThe third chapter discusses the various perspectives \u2013 trade distribution, liquidity needs, sequencing of settlements and overlap with global markets \u2013 through which the Group reviewed the trading and settlement timings."

    "output": "The report of the Working Group on Comprehensive Review of Trading and Settlement Timings of Markets Regulated by the Reserve Bank discusses that trading activity, across markets, was relatively well distributed. It discusses that the evolving liquidity management dynamics for market participants, in light of the availability of 24x7 payment systems and non-guaranteed settlements occurring after the close of money markets, provide scope for extension in the timings of the money markets. It also highlights the need for effective sequencing of settlement cycles and netting of settlements, where possible, to avoid liquidity gridlocks and minimise liquidity risks. Deliberations on the increasing participation of non-resident investors in the markets and on the practices being followed globally for easing their access are also set out.\nThe fourth chapter assesses the revision of trading and settlement timings for each market segment. It presents an assessment of the requests / feedback received from different stakeholders. The possibility of extending the timing for various segments of money market to optimize participants\u2019 liquidity management has been discussed while noting that extending beyond an optimum level may lead to undue volatility in rates amidst thin liquidity in the evening hours and also have implications on the settlement infrastructure. The feasibility / desirability of extension / curtailment in market trading hours for Government securities has been debated, taking into account the requirements of post market hours operational processes such as portfolio valuation and aspects related to providing a sufficiently long trading day to enable assimilation of new information into prices. The feasibility of providing a post onshore market hours window for price quotation to non-resident investors in the Government securities market was also discussed.  The optimal market hours for the foreign exchange market taking cognizance of the need to enable market participants to factor in developments and exchange rate movements in offshore market while recognising that facilities for undertaking foreign exchange transactions post onshore market hours is already available have also been discussed.\nThe recommendations of the Group are summarised in the fifth chapter. The Group recommends that the market hours of the call money market be extended till 7:00 PM while the market hours for market repo and TREP be synchronised and extended till 4:00 PM. The Group also recommends unifying the TREP trading hours for members settling obligation through Designated Settlement Banks (DSBs) and through the Reserve Bank. The Group recommends preponing the timing of pre-announced LAF auction to 9:30 AM \u2013 10:00 AM from 10:00 AM to 10:30 AM currently. With regard to the market hours for the Government securities market, the Group recommends that the current timings be continued with. However, post onshore market hours, transactions in Government securities with non-residents could be permitted during a time window between 5:00 PM and 11:30 PM. The Group recommends that such transactions, if permitted, be reported to NDS-OM on T+1 day before onshore market hours and settled on a T+2 basis. The Group does not recommend any changes in the trading hours for interest rate derivative and foreign exchange markets."

    "input": "Question: What role do financial markets play in economic development and what factors determine the efficiency of these markets?",
    "output": "Financial markets play a crucial role in economic development by allocating capital through efficient price discovery, facilitating risk management, and providing liquidity. Studies consistently link deep and liquid financial markets with macroeconomic stability and long-term economic prosperity. Market trading hours are considered one of the major determining factors in the efficient functioning of financial markets. However, different theoretical frameworks for the study of financial markets have placed differing emphasis on the role of market timings. The efficient market hypothesis, for example, assumes that markets reflect all available information, viewing trading times as a logistical necessity rather than an influencer of market efficiency. Market microstructure theories consider market trading hours an important determining factor for market functioning, establishing that market liquidity, volatility, and information asymmetry play a crucial role in price formation, with the time of day having a crucial impact on these aspects. Sociological perspectives view financial markets as social constructs, where trading times influence and are influenced by factors such as the culture of a financial center and its global interconnectedness. Operationally, trading hours are linked to human resource costs, settlement, and other operational considerations. Simply put, market hours must facilitate two objectives: being adequate for market participants to meet their trading requirements while addressing ethical considerations like fairness and the potential for manipulation, and facilitating adequate market liquidity to enable prices to adjust to evolving information and facilitate efficient price discovery, thereby providing seamless trade executions."

    "output": "The Reserve Bank\u2019s liquidity management operations, primarily conducted through the Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) and Open Market Operation (OMO), seek to ensure adequate liquidity in the system. These operations have important implications for market trading and settlement timings, as do the conduct and settlement of primary auctions in Central Government dated securities, Treasury Bills (T-Bills) and State Government Securities (SGSs). The LAF operations, through auctions, are typically carried out in the first half of the day. The OMO auctions are conducted mostly between 9:30 AM and 10:30 AM.

    "output": "Different markets have different settlement mechanisms and cycles. Call money transactions are bilaterally settled between participants, while outright trades and transactions in repo on Government securities are settled through Clearing Corporation of India Limited (CCIL) acting as a central counterparty (CCP) on delivery-versus-payment (DvP)-III basis. Commercial Papers (CPs) and Certificates of Deposit (CD) are settled bilaterally. Repo trades in corporate bonds are settled bilaterally or through AMC Repo Clearing Limited (ARCL) acting as a CCP. Interest Rate Derivative (IRD) transactions are settled by CCIL, either on a guaranteed or non-guaranteed basis, and also bilaterally between participants. Foreign exchange trades are also settled through CCIL as well as bilaterally. Liquidity operations of the Reserve Bank are gross settled bilaterally.\n\nA typical business day starts with the reversal of liquidity operations of the Reserve Bank before the markets open for trading. The settlement of primary auctions in the Government securities market takes place between 10:00 AM and 1:00 PM. Interest payments on / redemptions of dated securities, T-Bills and SGSs also take place in the morning. Outright trades in Government securities (executed on S-12 day) and transactions in repo on Government securities (executed on S day) are generally settled between 4:30 PM and 5:30 PM. The settlement of foreign exchange transactions through CCIL takes place, in multiple batches, during the window between 4:00 PM and 8:00 PM. After the markets close, the MSF and SDF of the Reserve Bank remain available till 11:59 PM. The Standing Liquidity Facility (SLF) is available from 9:00 AM to 2:00 PM.

    "output": "The last comprehensive review of market timings was conducted by an internal working group of the Reserve Bank in 2019. Its recommendations were kept in abeyance due to the pandemic. Since then, significant changes have occurred in the regulatory framework, market microstructure (including trading volumes, participants, and infrastructure), turnover in various markets, and the overall market structure due to domestic and global economic and regulatory changes. Volumes in overnight money markets have also shifted to collateralized segments, influenced by factors like increased collateral availability with banks, greater non-bank participation, and efficient trading and clearing systems. Additionally, the calibrated opening of Indian debt markets to non-residents, including the Fully Accessible Route (FAR), and the inclusion of Indian Government Bonds in global bond indices have contributed to these changes."

    "input": "Question: How has the market structure changed due to developments in the domestic and global economy, as well as regulatory changes, and what are the developments in trading and settlement mechanisms?",
    "output": "The market structure has undergone noticeable changes driven by developments in the domestic and global economy and regulatory changes. Volumes in the overnight money markets have increasingly moved to the collateralised segments, which is in line with the developments in global markets. The development has been driven by several factors such as availability of higher collaterals with banks, greater participation of non-bank entities, availability of efficient trading and clearing systems, etc. The calibrated opening of the Indian debt markets to non-residents, especially the operationalisation of the Fully Accessible Route (FAR), and the inclusion of Government securities in global bond indices have led to a steady increase in Foreign Portfolio Investor (FPI) holdings of Government securities. Non-resident participation has also increased in the IRD segment after they were permitted to access the onshore IRD market in 2019. Non-resident participation in the onshore foreign exchange market has also increased. Separately, regulatory changes enabled the participation of onshore entities in offshore markets. Banks in India operating IFSC Banking Units (IBUs) have been permitted to participate in the Non-Deliverable Forward (NDF) market with effect from June 1, 2020. Further, banks and SPDs in India have been permitted to undertake transactions in the offshore FCS-OIS market with non-residents and other market makers from February 10, 2022, and August 08, 2022, respectively. These regulatory changes have reduced the price differential between onshore and offshore markets and led to the emergence of an onshore interbank market in non-deliverable derivatives wherein local banks transact with each other and with users. There is now a greater variety of derivative products available in the market, pursuant to regulatory changes facilitating product innovation, to enable non-retail clients to optimise their hedging costs and effectively manage their risks. Several structured foreign exchange derivatives are now being traded in the domestic market. In the IRD market, new instruments such as bond Forward Rate Agreements (FRAs) and Total Return Swaps (TRS) are being offered to users. Recently, forward contracts in government securities have also been permitted.\n\nThe developments in trading as well as settlement mechanisms are as follows: most of the trading in the Indian markets has been intermediated by Electronic Trading Platforms (ETPs), additional facilities have been added by several ETPs over the last few years to provide flexibility in trade execution, API support has become increasingly common on the ETPs, new dealing modes have been enabled on ETPs, and ETPs have also been / are being introduced for instruments such as reference rate-based foreign exchange trades, where electronic trade execution was earlier not supported. Settlement mechanisms have also evolved as foreign exchange forwards with maturity up to thirty-six months are now being centrally cleared and settled, CCP-based clearing for modified MIFOR trades have been extended up to ten years, Tripartite repo settlements are now available for repos in corporate bonds through ARCL, and interbank trades in Government securities, foreign exchange spot and forwards, and interest rate swaps on MIBOR and Modified MMIFOR were centrally cleared."

Consequently, a working group was formed with representation from various stakeholders. Its terms of reference included:\n\ni. Review the current trading and settlement timings for various financial markets regulated by the Reserve Bank including functioning hours of market infrastructures for trading, clearing, settlement and reporting of transactions;\nii. Identify the frictions, challenges and issues, if any, in overall functioning of markets on account of current trading and settlement timings in terms of transmission of prices/rates across markets, volatility and distribution of trades, liquidity requirements, netting efficiency, etc.;\niii. To examine cross-country practices relating to market timings and their influence, if any, on market development in terms of participation, liquidity, volumes, etc.;\niv. To examine the implications, including benefits, costs and challenges, if any, in revising the current timings for trading and settlement; and\nv. To make recommendations on trading and settlement timings."

    "input": "Question: How does the Reserve Bank of India regulate financial markets, and what is the composition of the overnight money market in India?",
    "output": "The Reserve Bank of India, under the statutory provisions of various legislations including the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 2000, the Government Securities Act, 2006, and the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007, regulates the Government securities market, the money markets, the foreign exchange market and markets for derivatives on interest rate, foreign exchange and credit.\n\nThe overnight money market in India is the most liquid segment of the market and comprises the uncollateralised (call money) and collateralised (market repo and TREP) segments. The structure of money markets has witnessed a paradigm shift away from uncollateralised inter-bank market towards collateralised overnight markets comprising banks and non-bank entities. Between 2014-15 and 2024-25, the annual turnover in the overnight money market increased from `281.37 lakh crore to `1,324.05 lakh crore while the daily average turnover increased from `1.17 lakh crore to `5.52 lakh crore. This growth was largely driven by the expansion of the collateralised segment, where annual turnover rose from `245.27 lakh crore to `1,296.62 lakh crore even as the turnover in call money market declined from `36.10 lakh crore to `27.42 lakh crore.\n\nThe TREP segment accounts for the largest share in the overnight money market with 69 per cent of daily average volume in the market followed by market repo at 29 per cent. The share of call money has gradually come down from 13 per cent in 2014-15 to about 2 per cent in recent years."

    "output": "The call money market is accessible exclusively to banks and SPDs, which have access to the liquidity adjustment facilities of the Reserve Bank, with co-operative banks as major lenders and SPDs as primary borrowers. The collateralised segment of the overnight money market has a diversified participant base, including non-bank entities such as mutual funds, insurance companies, and corporates, in addition to banks and SPDs, where mutual funds are the major lenders and SPDs and banks are the largest borrowers. Transactions in the overnight money market are predominantly contracted over ETPs operated by Clearcorp Dealing Systems India Limited (Clearcorp). The Negotiated Dealing System \u2013 Call (NDS-Call) and the Clearcorp Repo Order Matching System (CROMS) platforms facilitate call money and market repo transactions respectively, while TREP transactions are executed on the Tri-party Repo Dealing System (TREPS) platform. Some call money and market repo transactions are also dealt bilaterally outside of ETPs and reported to CCIL. While all the three segments start trading at 9:00 AM, the market repo and TREP segments close at 2:30 PM and 3:00 PM respectively, whereas the call money market closes at 5:00 PM. Call market trades are settled bilaterally using the Real-Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system. Market repo and TREP transactions are settled along with outright transaction in Government securities on a DvP - III basis though CCIL, which acts as the CCP, eliminating counterparty risks and reducing liquidity requirements through multilateral netting. The settlement of repo transactions normally takes place on a T+0 basis between 4:30 PM and 5:30 PM."

    "output": "The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) manages liquidity through its Liquidity Management Framework (LMF), which has evolved to keep pace with changes in different market segments and the growing needs of participants. The RBI conducts variable rate repos and reverse repos of tenors from overnight to 14 days for short-term liquidity adjustment. It also conducts long term repos and other operations such as Open Market Operations (OMOs) and foreign exchange (FX) swaps to manage long term/durable liquidity needs.\n\nThe repo/reverse repo and OMO operations under the LMF are conducted over the Reserve Bank\u2019s e-Kuber platform, where participants submit their bids/offers electronically. The settlement of the first leg of all repos/reverse repos happens on the same day within an hour of the announcement of the auction result, while the settlement of the OMOs and the near leg of FX swaps is done on T+1 and spot (T+2) basis respectively.\n\nIn addition to the above operations, the Reserve Bank has also made available the standing facilities, viz., SDF and MSF which are available to eligible participants every day including on holidays to participants from 5:30 PM to 11:59 PM and the settlement of the same occurs in real-time. An optional automated sweep-in and sweep-out (ASISO) facility is also available in the e-Kuber system for eligible participants for the standing facilities.\n\nReversal of repos/ reverse repos as also the standing facilities is carried out at the beginning of the day of the second leg."

The settlement of primary auctions, coupon payments, and redemptions takes place between 10:00 AM and 1:00 PM. The OMO auctions are settled between 12:00 noon and 4:00 PM. Outright transactions in Government securities are settled on a T+1 basis, along with T+0 transactions of collateralised money markets, through the guaranteed settlement mechanism provided by the CCIL. FPIs may choose to settle the outright transactions in Government securities on T+1 or T+2 basis. The settlement starts after the close of trading hours of the collateralised segment of the money market and is typically completed between 4:30 PM to 5:30 PM."

Trades in the interbank MIBOR OIS market are primarily executed on ETPs. All OTC IRD transactions are mandatorily reported to a trade repository. CCIL provides CCP clearing and settlement for IRD transactions referenced to MIBOR and modified MIFOR. About 90 per cent of interbank MIBOR OIS and about 60 per cent of modified MIFOR IRS are CCP cleared. Non-resident participation in the market has also increased in recent years (Chart 2.10)."

    "output": "The Group reviewed the current trading and settlement timings for various financial markets regulated by the Reserve Bank, recognizing that optimal trading hours in financial markets are crucial for efficient market functioning and market development. Trading hours must be structured to facilitate efficient price discovery based on the flow of information, ensure adequate liquidity throughout the trading window, enable participants to fulfill their daily business requirements and support interbank participants in managing their positions after meeting client obligations. Trading hours also have implications for operating costs of market participants in terms of expenses related to human resources, market infrastructure, back-office operations for trade confirmation and settlement, liquidity provisioning, and regulatory compliance. Trading hours also need to be harmonized across different market segments and venues to enable the seamless transmission of price movements. Accordingly, the Group reviewed the trading and settlement timings from various diverse perspectives including market liquidity, transmission of prices, liquidity needs of participants, sequencing of settlements and alignment with global markets. The assessment is summarized below. Market liquidity plays a crucial role in price formation and efficiency. Higher liquidity enhances price discovery by reducing bid-ask spreads and allows traders to execute orders with minimal price impact. Deep and liquid markets absorb new information faster, improving price efficiency. Conversely, illiquidity can lead to price distortions, widening spreads, and increased transaction costs. The Group assessed the liquidity distribution across markets in this context."

    "output": "Trading in the Government securities market is more evenly distributed, albeit with slightly higher volumes during the first and last hour of the trading session. Trading interest is higher during the first hour as information released post close of previous day\u2019s trading session and overnight global developments are factored in. Market activity on account of allotments in primary auctions generally takes place towards the end of the trading session, leading to a slight uptick in volumes at that time. In recent months, this is also due to the release of key macroeconomic data towards the end of market hours pursuant to a change in time of release of the data by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MOSPI)."

The trade distribution indicates that though trading is permitted beyond onshore market hours, inter-bank spot transactions are concentrated between 9:00 AM and 3.30 PM, with only a small share of transactions taking place before or after onshore market hours (Charts 3.6 and 3.7).

Even in the case of the foreign exchange market and FCS-OIS where trading is permitted on a 24x5 basis, trading tends to be concentrated during the onshore market trading hours. Additionally, forward transactions (both deliverable and non-deliverable), trade in a wider time window with transactions being reported from 8:00 AM till 8:00 PM (Charts 3.8 and 3.9)."

    "output": "The last available interbank funding market of the day, closes at 5:00 PM. The distribution of interbank and customer RTGS transactions indicates that transactions are undertaken in sizeable quantum up to 7:00 PM (Chart 3.10).\n\nThere are non-guaranteed settlements occurring after the close of funding market. Any failure or delay in such settlements may create liquidity constraints for market participants. To illustrate, the reporting of RFQ trades in corporate bonds are now permitted till 4:00 PM, with the settlement window extending till 5:45 PM. There is no defined time window for the bilateral settlement of call money transactions. While interbank foreign exchange transactions are accepted by CCIL for guaranteed settlement, the INR leg of client transactions are settled bilaterally using RTGS. Handling any such delay or failure after close of money market can, at present, only be met through the Reserve Bank\u2019s liquidity window. This increases dependence on the liquidity facilities offered by the Reserve Bank. For market participants not having access to the Reserve Bank\u2019s liquidity window, no funding avenues are available.\n\nFeedback from mutual funds suggests that debt mutual funds, one of the largest participants in the market repo and TREP markets, often receive cash flow reports after 3:00 PM. With the collateralised money market segment closing by 3:00 PM, a part of their funds may remain undeployed. The Group also discussed that with T+0 cash settlement available on exchanges, corporates also have better visibility of their cash position by 3:30 PM."

    "input": "Question: What observations and discussions did the Working Group make regarding market timings, settlement sequencing, and non-resident participation in the Indian financial market?",
    "output": "The Group noted that while the current market timings of overnight money markets are largely adequate to meet the funding needs of most market participants, there remains scope for extension in the timings of the money market. The Group recognised that effective sequencing of settlement cycles and netting of settlements, where possible, are crucial to avoid liquidity gridlocks and minimise liquidity risks. Amidst the diverse settlement modes for different markets, the Group discussed a few potential changes in the extant settlement arrangements. The Group noted that the settlement of Government securities primary auctions occurs in the first half of the trading day, while the guaranteed settlement of secondary market transactions through CCIL (both outright and repo) takes place after the close of market. Due to this market participants may need to arrange for intraday liquidity or use the intraday credit line even if their net obligations in both the markets taken together are low / zero. Similarly, the settlement of Reserve Bank\u2019s liquidity operations is not netted with the settlement of the primary auctions of Government securities and secondary market transactions, creating intraday liquidity requirements. The Group also noted that as the reversal of the Reserve Bank\u2019s liquidity operations are carried out at the start of the day, before the opening of the money markets, market participants need to use overnight funds or intraday liquidity facilities from the Reserve Bank or intraday credit lines from banks to meet their obligations. The Group discussed the possibility of streamlining the settlement of call money transactions which are currently executed on or reported to the NDS-Call platform but are settled bilaterally. To this end, the Group deliberated on the possibility of the NDS-Call platform being enabled to automatically trigger an RTGS settlement upon the execution of call transactions on the NDS-Call platform. The Group, however, felt that while this may benefit the call money borrowers by providing immediate liquidity, there could be operational concerns for lenders to ensure the availability of funds at the time of call transactions. The Indian financial markets, especially the Government securities, foreign exchange markets and related derivatives market, are increasingly integrated with global markets. The Government securities market has witnessed sustained interest from non-resident investors following the introduction of the FAR in 2020 and the inclusion of Indian Government securities in global bond indices. The share of FPIs in trading volumes in the Government securities market has been steadily rising in the recent period."

    "input": "Question: What factors influence trading timings decisions across countries, and what strategies have different countries adopted to address the disconnect with global financial hubs?",
    "output": "Trading and settlement timings of financial markets across countries have evolved in response to a combination of market structure, regulatory requirements, technological capabilities, and global integration needs. Besides operational considerations including staffing and cost implications, geographic location and time zone considerations also impact trading timings decisions. Flexibilities in market hours tend to be adopted more by countries located in the eastern-most and western-most geographies. Countries in the eastern part of Asia have tended to adapt their market timings to address the disconnect with the global financial hubs in Europe and North America. Different models have been followed by different countries. For example, Japan and Hong Kong have extended market hours to enhance the overlap with trading hours of major financial hubs in the West. In July 2024, the trading hours of the Korean (KRW/USD) foreign exchange market were extended until 2:00 AM local time the next day (from 09:00 AM to 03:30 PM earlier) to cover the trading hours of the financial markets in London. Other Asian economies like Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia have permitted market makers to provide quotes/prices to US-based FPIs beyond onshore trading hours. In most East Asian nations, government bonds are permitted to be traded beyond onshore market hours for offshore investors. In many cases, however, the average volumes of trades in post onshore market trading hours are not very substantial. The average daily volumes of Indonesian, Thai and Malay bonds is about USD 25 million during US hours. Such a model may be more relevant for jurisdictions, wherein, there is demand (although limited) from foreign investors after close of onshore markets. Several Asian jurisdictions have included lunch breaks of varying duration during their respective trading hours, which provides a respite from intense trading activity for the traders and allows markets to delay their closing, thereby increasing the overlap with markets operating in later time zones."

    "output": "Countries have adopted measures to tap into global investors\u2019 appetite and enhance access to their onshore markets. China implemented the China Bond Connect in July 2017, an investment channel that gives overseas investors access to fixed income markets in Mainland China via trading infrastructure in Hong Kong. This allows overseas investors to settle and hold bonds via nominee account structures instead of opening onshore accounts. The China Bond Connect is the fourth official channel for international investors to invest in China\u2019s onshore fixed income market, the other channels being the China Interbank Bond Market (CIBM) Direct, the Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (QFII) Scheme, and RMB Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (RQFII) Scheme. Various jurisdictions have adopted bespoke models to cater to the global investors\u2019 demand and establish connectivity with the global financial markets. The operational and the risk management challenges associated with these initiatives have also influenced choices. Also, the different models have evolved in line with the overall regulatory and the capital account convertibility framework of the countries, in addition to the market conditions and the level of sophistication of participants involved."

    "output": "The Group systematically analysed the perspectives outlined in the previous chapter for each market segment, integrating stakeholder feedback to refine its assessment of optimal trading and settlement timings. The Group noted the lack of availability of interbank funding avenues post 5:00 PM even though payment systems are operational. The daily balances held by banks at the close of business on each day (close to midnight) are considered for computation of Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) and Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR). Interbank and customer foreign exchange transactions by banks undertaken beyond onshore trading hours also have implications for liquidity management. Settlement timings in the corporate bond market and cash flow patterns of mutual funds also call for availability of money markets beyond the currently available window. The limitations imposed by the trading timings of the money market increases the reliance on liquidity facilities provided by the Reserve Bank while posing challenges for participants not having access to such facilities. Different stakeholders suggested the Group to consider extending the timing of call money market till 7:30 PM or 8:00 PM to provide an interbank funding avenue after 5:00 PM. The Group also received unanimous feedback from different stakeholders, that the market repo and TREP trading windows should be extended to better accommodate funding requirements of market participants, especially the non-bank entities. While most stakeholders requested extension in market hours till 4:00 PM, some stakeholders also requested extension till 5:00 PM. One of the members suggested that the market hours be extended till 3:30 PM as most of the market participants crystalise their fund flows by 3:00 PM and would be in a position to deploy their funds by 3:30 PM. The Group also discussed the possibility of unifying the market repo and TREP trading hours and unifying the TREP trading hours for participants settling directly with the Reserve Bank and participants settling through Designated Settlement Banks (DSBs) (at present, the market hours for participants settling through DSBs closes 30 minutes ahead of other participants). The Group noted that the bilateral settlement of call money transactions is dependent only on the availability of payment systems, and any extension would neither impact other settlements nor require any changes in the settlement infrastructure. However, extending beyond an optimum level may lead to undue volatility in rates amidst thin liquidity and impact the weighted average call rate (WACR) calculation. Further, most RTGS transactions are completed by 7:00 PM (para 3.9). Therefore, on balance, the Group felt that the availability of call money market till 7:00 PM may provide banks with adequate flexibility to cover requirements related to unanticipated flows. The Group also noted that any extension in market timings of call money market must be accompanied by similar extension in reporting of cancellation of call money transactions \u2013 the window for which presently closes at 5:30 PM."

    "output": "The Group noted that the settlement of collateralised money market transactions is intertwined with the settlement of secondary market transactions in Government securities. Therefore, any extension in the trading timings for collateralised money market segments will also impact the settlement of Government securities transactions as well as settlement activities of the market participants. On balance, the Group suggested extending the trading timings of market repo and TREP till 4:00 PM.\n\nAs the participant base for both market repo and TREP segments remains the same, maintaining different trading hours for these segments offers no significant advantage as both are settled together. The Group felt that uniformity in the trading hours would help mitigate the additional pressure on the TREP segment during the final half-hour of trading and provide market participants with greater flexibility in selecting a segment to meet their funding requirements. The Group recognized that extending the trading hours of market repo and TREP would result in the settlement of the segments being extended to 5:30 PM \u2013 6:30 PM. The general feedback which the Group received from its various stakeholders was that the associated operational challenges were manageable.\n\nCCIL indicated that with recent improvements in fund settlement mechanisms through DSBs, the need for differential trading hours no longer exists. Accordingly, the Group felt that with the operational constraint removed, uniformity in trading timings for all participants of TREP segment could be considered.\n\nThe Group received feedback that the reversal of market repo trades at the end of the day resulted in lenders in the market being forced to avail intraday liquidity. The reversal of repo trades in the morning, on the other hand, will ensure availability of funds for market participants \u2013 especially lenders \u2013 to manage their intraday liquidity requirements. The Group, however, noted that an early settlement of the reversals of repo trades could reduce the netting efficiency of current settlements and also require borrowers to arrange for funds at the beginning of the day. It felt that this may lead to additional liquidity pressures on market participants and was, therefore, not in favor of any change.\n\nThe Group assessed the difficulties posed by the early reversal of the Reserve Bank\u2019s liquidity operations (typically between 5:00 AM and 7:00 AM) and discussed the feasibility of shifting the time to around 9:30 AM -10:00 AM.

    "output": "The Group assessed the difficulties posed by the early reversal of the Reserve Bank\u2019s liquidity operations (typically between 5:00 AM and 7:00 AM) and discussed the feasibility of shifting the time to around 9:30 AM -10:00 AM, feeling that this would enable market participants to utilize the funds for settlement of primary auctions and reduce dependence on available credit lines. At the same time, the Group felt that it would need to be ensured that the reversal of the liquidity operations take place before the liquidity auctions for the day. Postponing the timing of reversal of the liquidity operations would entail a concomitant postponement of the auction timings for the current day\u2019s operations, which could have its own implications for the overall functioning of the markets. The Group also discussed the benefits of preponing the daily liquidity operations of the Reserve Bank from the current window of 10:00 AM - 10:30 AM to 9:30 AM -10:00 AM. On balance, the group felt that postponing the reversal of the Reserve Bank\u2019s liquidity operations may pose its own set of challenges but felt that there are benefits associated with preponing the daily auction to an earlier time window.\n\nThe Group also assessed the adequacy of trading and settlement timings of the Government securities market in the context of evolving market dynamics, including the needs of domestic participants and the growing interest of non-resident investors. It noted that the trading activity in the Government securities market is fairly well distributed throughout the trading hours and adequately factors the information released during and post trading hours. While most stakeholders suggested retention of current market timings, the Group received feedback both for shortening of the trading timings as well as extension of trading timings. \n\nThe curtailment of trading timings of the Government securities market to 3:30 PM was suggested by certain market participants to align the same with the timings of the equity market. This adjustment, they suggested, would bring uniformity in trading timings across asset classes and may facilitate the timely completion of post-market activities such as valuations of portfolios at the end of the working day. The stakeholders added that the experience with truncated trading hours during the COVID-19 period made a case for shorter trading hours as the market was able to meet its trading requirements within a shorter trading window.\n\nThe Group deliberated on this feedback, noting that the revision in timing for release of key economic data, from 5:30 PM to 4:00 PM, could potentially lead to increased short-term volatility in the Government securities market during those periods. Thus, there may be merit in reducing the current market trading timings. The Group also discussed curtailment in trading hours to align the timings of Government securities and equity markets.\n\nThe Group, however, felt that the trading dynamics of these markets differ. Equity prices fluctuate with company performance, investor sentiment, and market news, whereas the value of debt instruments hinges on prevailing interest rates, time to maturity, inflation expectations."

    "output": "The Working Group considered several factors when assessing the trading and settlement timings of the Government securities market. They noted that equity prices fluctuate with company performance, investor sentiment, and market news, whereas the value of debt instruments hinges on prevailing interest rates, time to maturity, and macroeconomic shifts. They also observed that bond markets are dominated by institutional investors seeking predictable income and capital preservation, unlike equity markets which attract a broader mix of retail and institutional traders.\n\nThe Group discussed the possible impact of any curtailment in timings for Government securities market on non-resident participation, particularly in light of the growing interest of non-residents in the Indian markets. While some participants suggested an extension in trading hours so that there is an overlap with the US markets to cater to non-resident investors, the Group noted that extending trading timings may lead to a distribution of existing liquidity in the market over a longer period, in the absence of any significant incremental trading demand, and could adversely influence the price transmission and market efficiency. Second, the extended trading timings may pose challenges in terms of operational overheads, especially with respect to settlement processing and back-office functions.\n\nUltimately, the Group felt that each market\u2019s trading hours should be set according to its own liquidity patterns and price-discovery needs and was of the view that the extant trading hours for Government securities markets be retained. Therefore, the Group was not in favor of extension in the current market timings of the Government securities market."

    "output": "The Group felt that permitting market-makers to offer quotes to non-residents post onshore trading hours would be a better alternative, considering that foreign exchange markets are primarily driven by currency conversion needs and are globally more liquid than debt markets, which meet financing and investment needs, and that while most FPIs investing in India have an Asian office and are able to meet their requirements during the onshore trading hours, there are also US-based investors without presence in Asia who face difficulties in investing in Government securities. \n\nThe Group deliberated on two potential models for post onshore market price quoting to non-resident investors:\n\u2022 Allowing price quotations from 5:00 PM to 6:00 AM on the next working day.\n\u2022 Allowing price quotations from 5:00 PM to 11:30 PM.\nIn both cases, transactions post onshore market hours will be undertaken on a T+2 settlement basis (as is already allowed for FPIs) and will be reported to NDS-OM for settlement during a window between 7:00 AM and 8:30 AM on T+1 date.\nAfter reviewing operational feasibility of each option, the Group felt that a window till 11:30 PM to provide quotes to non-residents would adequately meet the requirement of overlap with the US market. The Group noted that if trades post onshore market hours are permitted, CCIL would be required to make appropriate arrangements at their end to facilitate reporting of such trades on T+1 date. The Group also felt that the quantum of trades post onshore market hours was not expected to be large (as has been the experience of peer Asian economies). This mechanism may be reviewed at a later period based on the experience and trends in trading volume. \n\nRegarding settlement of primary auction of Government securities, OMO and secondary market transactions in Government securities, the Group deliberated on suggestions by a few stakeholders to shift the settlement of primary market auctions to a later part of the day as this could provide participants with more time to arrange for funds. The Group noted that while shifting the primary auction settlement to the second half of the day is operationally viable, some participants use securities allotted in the primary auction as collateral for borrowing in market repo and TREP. It, therefore, felt that settlement timing of primary auction should not be changed.\n\nRegarding merging the primary auction settlement with settlement of secondary market transactions, the Group discussed the possibility, noting that the merger of primary and secondary market settlements could significantly enhance netting efficiencies and reduce liquidity requirements. However, the Group acknowledged the legal and operational challenges associated with merging of the settlement of primary auctions, which are not guaranteed by the CCIL, and secondary market transactions which are guaranteed. Similar challenges would also arise in case."

    "output": "The Group received mixed suggestions regarding the timing of the foreign exchange market. One view was that the current market timings should be retained because: (a) the current trading hours are sufficient to meet the needs of the market participants; (b) post market hours trading is permitted for both residents and non-residents, if required; and (c) the uniform timing of equity and foreign exchange market may be retained. Another view supported the extension in current trading timing of foreign exchange market till 5:00 PM suggesting that the curtailed timing of foreign exchange market during COVID-19 pandemic has not been restored. Also, while larger participants were able to trade post market hours, the facility may not be uniformly available to all clients. Further, extension of market hours till 5:00 PM will be in alignment with other markets such as Government securities, IRD, etc. The Group did not receive any suggestion on timings of exchange traded currency derivatives market."

    "output": "Based on mixed feedback, FEDAI conducted a member consultation and reported that the current trading timing of the foreign exchange market is adequate, especially with the option of transacting beyond onshore market hours and sufficient overlap with Asian and European markets. The Group felt that current market timings adequately meet the needs of market participants, noting that most transactions are concentrated during onshore hours despite the 24x5 availability. Therefore, the Group recommended that existing market trading timings for the foreign exchange market and related derivatives market should remain unchanged. The Group also decided to retain the single daily settlement of OTC foreign exchange transactions by CCIL, determining that splitting the settlement may minimize the netting benefits achieved."

    "output": "The Group reviewed the existing trading and settlement timing of various markets regulated by the Reserve Bank in the light of the developments in the financial markets over the last decade or so, as set out in Chapter 2 of this Report, taking cognisance of the various considerations impacting and being impacted by market timings, as set out in Chapter 3 of this Report, as well as the various feedback gathered by the Group during its interactions with different sets of market participants, as set out in Chapter 4. The Group aimed to assess whether the current trading and settlement timings continue to support market efficiency and to make recommendations on where changes in the timings can foster greater efficiencies. While making its recommendations, the Group remained mindful of associated operational feasibilities and infrastructure capabilities of market participants and market infrastructure providers. Based on these aspects, the Group makes the following recommendations:\nMoney Market\n5.1 Extend the call money market timings to 7:00 PM. Concomitantly, the reporting window for NDS-Call transactions, including for cancellations, should also be extended to 7:30 PM.   \n5.2 Unify and extend the timings of market repo and TREP trading hours till 4:00 PM.\n5.3 Unify the TREP trading hours for members settling obligations through DSBs and through the Reserve Bank. \n5.4 The settlement timings for repo transactions to be shifted to 5:30 PM \u2013 6:30 PM in consonance with the shift in trading hours.\n5.5 Prepone the pre-announced LAF auction timing to 9:30 AM \u2013 10:00 AM. Fine-tuning auctions may continue to be held at any time during the day based on evolving liquidity needs.\nGovernment Securities Market\n5.6 Maintain the existing market trading timings of 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM. \n5.7 Permit post onshore market hours transactions in Government securities with non-residents during a time window of 5:00 PM to 11:30 PM. Such transactions must be reported to NDS-OM on T+1 day between 7:00 AM \u2013 8:30 AM, with settlement on a T+2 basis.\n5.8 The settlement timings for Government securities will shift to 5:30 PM \u2013 6:30 PM in line with the settlement of TREP and market repo.\nInterest Rate Derivative Market\n5.9 Retain the existing market hours for interest rate derivatives (OTC and exchange-traded)."

    "output": "Guarantee is a potential future liability that is contingent on the occurring of an unforeseen future event. If these liabilities get crystallised without having adequate buffer, it may lead to increase in expenditure, deficit, and debt levels for the State Government. If the guarantee invoked is not honoured, it may cause reputational damages and legal costs to the Guarantor. It is, therefore, important to assess, monitor and be prudent while issuing guarantees, especially, when such guarantees are issued by a State Government. Besides, State Government should be transparent in terms of data disclosure and assessing the risk associated with it. Another related concern associated with the guarantees extended by the states, has been the increasing bank finance to Government owned entities backed by Government guarantee, especially, where the bank finance appeared to substitute budgetary resources of the State Governments."

Government Guarantees should, however, not be used to obtain finance through State owned entities, which substitutes budgetary resources of the State Government. Government Guarantees should not be allowed for creating direct liability/de-facto liability on the state. \ne) In order to ensure uniformity and consistency in data being reported, the State Governments may publish/ disclose data relating to guarantees, as per the Indian Government Accounting Standard (IGAS) recommended by Government of India, which can also be used by CAG for their audit and by RBI for its annual publication \u2018State Finances: A Study of Budgets\u2019. \nf) The Group is of the view that a reasonable ceiling on issuance of guarantees by the State Governments may be desirable. The Group recommends a ceiling for incremental guarantees issued during a year at 5 per cent of Revenue Receipts or 0.5 per cent of GSDP, whichever is less. \ng) State Governments should classify the projects/ activities as high risk, medium risk and low risk and assign appropriate risk weights before extending guarantee for them. Such risk categorization should also take into consideration past record of defaults. The Group suggests that the states should conservatively keep the lowest slab of risk weight at 100 per cent. Additionally, states should disclose their methodology for assigning risk weight. \nh) The guarantee fee charged should reflect the riskiness of the borrowers / projects / activities.

RBI had previously raised concerns about bank finance to government-owned entities, often in violation of prudential guidelines. Given that most of these loans are backed by explicit guarantees from State Governments, it was deemed necessary for states to consider the risk of these guarantees being invoked, and for lending banks/NBFCs to comprehensively assess loan proposals without relying solely on state guarantees. \n\nTaking note of the various risks involved with the guarantees issued by the states on their fiscal health, it was decided in the SFS Conference to constitute a Working Group, comprising members drawn from MoF, Government of India (GoI); select State Governments; and special invitees from departments concerned within the RBI, that would look into all the related issues concerning guarantees extended by the State Government s.

    "input": "Question: What are state government guarantees, their implications, and the parties involved?",
    "output": "State Government Guarantees: Issues and Challenges:\n\nGuarantee is a type of contingent liability protecting the investor/ lender from the risk of default by a borrower. Guarantees are usually sought when the investors/ lenders are unwilling to bear the risk of default. A contract of guarantee, as defined in the Indian Contracts Act, 1872 is a contract to perform the promise, or discharge the liability of a third person in case of default. A guarantee contract is different from an indemnity contract in which there are two parties involved and one party promises to save the other from loss caused by the promisor, or by the conduct of any third party.\n\nThere are usually three parties involved in State Government guarantees, namely, the borrower, which is usually a government owned or sponsored enterprise, the guarantee provider which is the State Government, and the lender who is also the beneficiary of the guarantee. Guarantees while being innocuous in good times, may lead to significant fiscal risks and may burden the state finances leading to large unanticipated cash outflows and increased debt. As upfront cash payment is usually not required in case of guarantees , that may be one of the reasons why the State Government guarantees have profligated in recent times. As these liabilities are contingent upon certain events, the quantum and timing of potential costs / cash outflows owing to guarantees are often difficult to estimate. Accordingly, their management is difficult and are typically not reported in budget deficit (Razlog et. al., 2020). A framework on issuance and management of guarantees can, however, help governments overcome these difficulties to some extent.\n\nState Governments are often required to sanction, and issue, on behalf of various state enterprises/ cooperative institutions/ urban local bodies and other state-owned entities, guarantees in favour of their lenders which are generally commercial banks or other financial institutions. There is a specific ceiling of 0.5 per cent of GDP for additional guarantees to be issued by the Central Government in a financial year as stipulated under the FRBM Act."

    "input": "Question: How can transparency in the disclosure of information relating to guarantees be improved, and why is a true assessment of a state's fiscal position important?",
    "output": "To improve transparency in disclosure of information relating to guarantees, the Ministry of Finance, Government of India, issued accounting standard/disclosure requirements in December 2010 regarding guarantees given by the Governments (GoI, 2010). This standard applies to the preparation of the Statement of Guarantees for inclusion and presentation in the financial statements of the Union, States, and Union Territories. While the Central Government has been disclosing the information in the prescribed format (Annex I) as part of its budget documents, very few states are doing so.\n\nConventional framework of fiscal analysis does not provide much insight on the guarantees and the associated risks and focuses mainly on the budgetary indicators. Guarantees are not recognized in macroeconomic fiscal statistics unless the triggering event is deemed to have occurred (Saxena, 2017). The Twelfth Finance Commission observed that although contingent liabilities do not directly form a part of the debt burden of the state, the state will be required to meet the debt service obligations in the event of default by the borrowing agency (GoI, 2004). These guarantees are classified under \u2018concontingent liabilities\u2019 of the states as they come into play on the occurrence of a pre- specified event agreed in the guarantee contract. Accordingly, a true assessment of the fiscal position of a state by taking into account the guarantees outstanding is important to assess its fiscal health. In the larger public interest and for the sake of transparency, complete data on guarantees should be distinctly disclosed on a regular basis and made available for public scrutiny."

    "output": "Guarantees should be examined in the same manner as a loan proposal, taking into account, inter alia, the credit-worthiness of the borrower, the extent of exposure sought to be covered by a sovereign guarantee, the terms of the borrowing, justification and public purpose to be served, probability of invocation and possible costs of such liabilities, etc. The Government will be liable to pay in case the entity/ organization defaults in respect of which guarantee is given. The Group is of the view that there should not be any distinction between Conditional / Unconditional, Financial / Performance guarantees for the purpose of arriving at total amount of guarantees extended by the Government as all of these would be in the nature of contingent liability that might crystallize at a future date. Additionally, the word \u2018Guarantee\u2019 should be used in a broader sense and may include all such instruments, by whatever name they are called, if these created an obligation on the part of the issuer for making payment on behalf of the borrower at a future date, contingent or otherwise."

    "input": "Question: What are the potential risks associated with government guarantees, and how can fiscal transparency and accountability help minimize these risks?",
    "output": "Guarantees can create moral hazard, leading the guaranteed entity to be sub-optimal in performing its obligation. Investors and lenders may have less incentive to perform due diligence in scrutinizing the project as against the classic non-recourse project financing. The risk arises from the potential negative impact on the fiscal/financial position of the State Government due to factors that affect the performance of the borrowing state enterprises. As it is difficult to predict the invocation of guarantees and the size of the pay-out, they usually are not scrutinized with the same rigor as it is done under the budget process in case of regular spending. Upon its invocation, it is possible that the Government may not have fiscal capacity to meet the obligation. Such problems could magnify when guarantees have been given to multiple state enterprises, while the state budget is already stressed. Various factors such as macroeconomic shocks and the realization of contingent liabilities could cause fiscal risks for State Governments. State Governments can also undertake implementation of specified projects through state agencies and provide guarantees on behalf of those entities for borrowing from banks/financial institutions. Such arrangements do not fall within the annual borrowing ceiling fixed by the Central Government for the individual State Government. Often termed as \u2018off budget borrowing\u2019, this is an explicit liability of the State Government, though not reflected as a debt in the budgetary documents. International institutions, including the IMF, have long been advocating fiscal transparency and accountability as a way to identify, monitor, and ultimately minimize fiscal risks. With regard to risks arising from guarantees, a prudent fiscal policy has to deal with three related areas: (i) the exposure to guarantees and policy for the same; ii) data disclosure and ensuring discipline in issuance of guarantees; and iii) management of related risks. Recognizing the risks from the guarantees, many countries have started disclosing data on the guarantees either in their budget documents or in other government reports."

    "input": "Question: How are government guarantees disclosed across different countries, and what types of data are typically included in these disclosures?",
    "output": "Government guarantees are disclosed by many countries in different forms, such as budget documents or other reports submitted to their parliament. New Zealand and Australia are pioneering countries in the management of fiscal risks and in disclosing guarantees related data. Finland, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom developed their data disclosure framework after the 2008 Global Financial Crisis. Several emerging markets, including Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Indonesia, Peru, and South Africa, also started releasing guarantee-related data.\n\nThere are significant variations across countries in terms of the disclosure of guarantee-related data, reflecting their relative significance. Explicit loan guarantees are disclosed by all countries that are disclosing contingent liabilities. Information related to public-private partnerships (PPP)-type arrangements, like minimum revenue guarantees or exchange rate guarantees, is generally limited (Chile, Colombia, Indonesia, Peru, United Kingdom). Countries also report various other types of contingent liabilities, such as pension and deposit guarantees (Chile, the United States).\n\nGuarantees data is mostly reported in the financial statements of countries (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United States). This is usually required under the international or national accounting standards. Some countries, such as India, Greece, and South Africa, report guarantees in their budget documents. Colombia and Peru report them in their medium-term fiscal framework, while Japan and Turkey release them as part of debt reports. Fiscal risk statements are also being prepared by Brazil, Chile, Finland, Indonesia, Kenya, and the Philippines where data on guarantees are disclosed.\n\nConsidering the fiscal significance of guarantees, they are reported through a variety of measures. First, the face value, which is most commonly reported by countries, is known at the time of issuance of the guarantee and reflects the maximum loss to the guarantor. Countries such as Australia, New Zealand, the United States, and Chile report the face value of the guarantees issued. Second, for arriving at the expected losses, the probability of the guarantees being invoked has to be estimated, in addition to the amount. Chile, Colombia, and Peru disclose the expected losses for various guarantees.\n\nImplicit contingent liabilities are not reported by most countries. Reporting and quantifying implicit contingent liabilities as explicit liabilities could reinforce moral hazard if it is interpreted as the Government\u2019s commitment or as an indication that the Government is likely to support future financial assistance."

    "output": "Management of guarantees can be strengthened by taking the following steps (Saxena, 2017):\n\n*   Regulating the issuance of guarantees through a policy framework \u2013 Governments need to formulate a framework with regard to ceiling and providing guidance on projects/ borrowing entities/ timings when guarantees can be considered, fees to be charged, and how risk from guarantees are to be contained.\n*   Developing capacity to evaluate guarantee proposals and assess associated risks.\n*   Developing measures to mitigate risks - Governments can introduce risk-based fees, partial guarantees, reinsurance, contingency or redemption reserves, etc.\n\nAustralia, Colombia, Indonesia, and Sweden consider the credit rating of beneficiaries in order to assess the associated risks with issuances of guarantees. It offers the benefits of a standardized approach, access to credit rating agencies and is generally cost-efficient. In the second approach followed by a few countries (e.g. Turkey), statistical techniques are used to build a financial distress index based on weighted profitability and balance sheet ratios. A discriminant analysis is used to obtain these weights and it can be adapted based on the nature of the entity being evaluated. In the third approach used by a few countries such as Chile, Colombia and Sweden, stochastic simulation is used to develop different scenarios and to assess the associated risks.\n\nRisk-based fee, charged by the Government for the guarantees extended, can lower the demand for guarantees and could lead to greater discipline amongst the borrowers. Under this framework guarantees are not treated equally, instead higher fees are charged for riskier projects. Countries such as Colombia, Sweden, and the United States revalue the guarantees periodically during their tenor and adjust the pricing accordingly."

    "output": "State Government finances, already constrained by COVID-19 pandemic, have been facing new sources of risks in the form of rising expenditure on non-essential heads, expanding contingent liabilities, and the ballooning overdues of DISCOMs. Fiscal risks can arise from macroeconomic shocks on crystallisation of the contingent liabilities which can either be \u2018explicit\u2019, viz., government loan guarantees, or \u2018implicit\u2019, wherein even without any specific guarantee, there is widespread public expectation that the Government would rescue or bailout the troubled entities (Mukherjee et. al., 2022). RBI has, in the past, examined the implications of states\u2019 contingent liabilities/ guarantees on their finances (Box II). RBI also played an active role in designing \u2018Model Fiscal Responsibility Legislation\u2019 for the states, which paved the way for the introduction of fiscal rules by some of the State Governments under their respective FRBM Acts. Several of these initiatives were the outcome of discussion held at the interactive platform provided by the RBI in the form of annual Conference of State Finance Secretaries. RBI, in its role as the cash and debt manager of the states, keeps sensitising them on various issues of concern that have a bearing on their finances. The genesis of concern with respect to guarantees dates back to late 1990s when their issuances rose substantially in the wake of the poor fiscal position of some of the states which hampered the provision of direct financial support to the state PSUs (RBI, 1999). RBI constituted a Technical Committee on State Government Guarantees (1999) to examine all aspects relating to State Government guarantees. The Committee stipulated a ceiling on the guarantees and recommended setting up of GRF to provide a cushion to service contingent liability arising from invocation of guarantees. As per the scheme introduced by RBI in 2001, the states had to contribute an amount equal to one-fifth of the incremental guarantees issued during the year. Accordingly, several State Governments stipulated a ceiling on their guarantees and set up GRFs."

    "output": "Taking cognizance of the sharp increase in guarantees issued by the states and its possible adverse impact on their fiscal health, Reserve Bank set up various committees/groups (Annex II) at different points of time in the past. Though the recommendations made by each of them largely varied from one another, most of them have highlighted the need to monitor and report contingent liabilities/guarantees as part of the fiscal risk assessment process of the state liabilities. Some of these Committees/Groups were as under:\n1. Technical Committee on State Government Guarantees (1999): Based on the recommendations made by the Technical Committee, several states had taken initiative for fixing a ceiling on guarantees, charging guarantee fees, reporting and monitoring of guarantees, including, letter of comfort and other assured payment arrangements, etc.\n2. Core Group on Voluntary Disclosure Norms for State Governments (2001): The Group persuaded the states to disseminate more information in \u2018Budget at a Glance\u2019 on a time series basis along with other fiscal indicators of contingent liabilities including guarantees.\n3. Group to Assess the Fiscal Risk of State Government Guarantees (2002): A serious attempt towards assessing and measuring fiscal risks of contingent liabilities was made by the Working Group which, inter alia, recommended a uniform format to be used for publishing data on both the annual sanctions as well as the outstanding amount of guarantees in the annual budget. The Group felt that the fiscal risk could be measured by classifying projects/ activities as high risk, medium risk, low risk and very low risk and assigning appropriate risk weights.\n4. Working Group on Information on State Government Guaranteed Advances and Bonds (2003): The Group viewed transparency in information disclosure as crucial to enhance market discipline and suggested proper rating of projects that were guaranteed by the State Governments. The Group also emphasized on the desirability of disseminating the information related to defaults and urged each regulator involved to seek legal opinion on the issue. Instead of publication of data at the issuer level, which in any case was being addressed by the Government Accounting Standards Board (GASAB), the Working Group viewed that : (i) individual lender/investor- wise data (broken up into sectors) and (ii) state -wise data on guaranteed advances and investments (including defaults) could be disseminated through RBI publications.\n5. Working Group on Compilation of State Government Liabilities (2005): The Group constituted with the objective of examining the extant methodologies of compilation of State Government liabilities by various agencies noted that the implicit liabilities that include off-budget borrowings, contingent liabilities, pensions and state public sector liabilities should be excluded from the definition of state liabilities or debt. It, however, recommended that the same might be disclosed in the financial statements along with estimates of debt."

Data on outstanding guarantees is being published by most states, particularly those that have made disclosure mandatory under their FRBM rules, publishing it as part of budget documents. Some states publish guarantee-related data even without mandatory FRBM rules, and a few publish data on risk-weighted guarantees. However, details such as sector/project-wise outstanding amounts, amounts issued during the year, amounts invoked during the year, and whether invoked amounts were paid are disclosed by only a few states. The format used for reporting guarantee data lacks uniformity, making meaningful comparison among states difficult. While RBI's annual publication, \"State Finance: A Study of Budgets,\" publishes state-wise total outstanding guarantees sourced from individual states, it provides limited information on the coverage or type of guarantees, sectors to which guarantees have been given, etc., potentially limiting its usage for stakeholders like governments, regulators, investors/lenders, and researchers. It is recommended that states disclose the total amount of guarantees extended during the year, outstanding guarantees at the end of the year, and guarantees invoked during the year in their annual budget documents, as per the IGAS (Annex I) recommended by the Government of India (GoI, 2010), which can also be used by CAG for their audit and."

The extant ceilings fixed by the states lacked uniformity, e.g., some states have fixed their ceilings on annual incremental guarantees to be issued, some have ceilings fixed in terms of annual incremental risk weighed guarantees, while a few others have fixed in terms of total outstanding guarantees. There is also lack of uniformity in terms of variable(s) to which these ceilings are linked, viz. certain percentage of either total revenue receipts or GSDP. The Group suggests linking of incremental guarantees to be issued during the year to Revenue Receipts (RR) and GSDP.\n\nDuring the period 2017-21, the amount of incremental guarantees issued in a year has remained below 10 per cent of their RR for majority of the states. Recognising the risks associated with the burgeoning guarantees on the fiscal health of the states, the Group proposes a ceiling for incremental guarantees issued during a year at 5 per cent of RR or 0.5 per cent of GSDP, whichever is less."

    "output": "State Governments have been issuing guarantees on behalf of state public enterprises belonging to various sectors viz. power, co-operative, agriculture, transport, water supply, sanitation, housing, communication, industries, etc. The probability of default could vary across sectors, depending on the financial parameters of the sector and varying impact of macroeconomic shock. Therefore, reporting only the nominal value of guarantees may not present the true picture of the risk that the State Government would be exposed to. States should classify the projects/ activities as high risk, medium risk and low risk and assign appropriate risk weights before extending guarantees (RBI, 2002). Many states have started releasing information on risk weighted guarantees. It is also observed that some of the states are assigning risk weights that are much lower than 100 per cent, thereby, under-reporting the amount of guarantees issued. The Group recommends that the minimum risk weight for any guarantee extended by the State Government should be 100 per cent."

Additionally, states should disclose their methodology for assigning the risk weights. Funds collected through guarantee fees should be used to create and build the GRF. Additionally, the fee should be structured in a manner that it acts as a deterrent in seeking guarantees for the riskier projects. A minimum of 0.25 per cent per annum may be considered as the base or minimum guarantee fee and additional risk premium, based on risk assessment by the State Government, maybe charged to each risk category of issuances. The Guarantee fee should also be linked to the tenor of the underlying loan. The objective of the GRF is to provide a cushion for servicing contingent liabilities arising from the invocation of guarantees issued by the State Governments in respect of bonds and other borrowings by state level undertakings or other bodies. Though the participation from the states in GRF is voluntary, 19 states have already established GRF. The GRF corpus managed by RBI stood at Rs. 10,839 crore as on March 31, 2023."

Though the participation from the states in GRF is voluntary, 19 states have already established GRF. The GRF corpus managed by RBI stood at Rs. 10,839 crore as on March 31, 2023 (Table 3.1). States are financing their fiscal deficit largely through market borrowings. The funds parked in the GRF are invested in eligible Government securities. The states which are yet to become members of GRF and the states which are members but have not been regularly contributing to the fund, often cite the negative \u2018carry\u2019 on such contributions, i.e., the cost of raising fund is usually higher than the return generated by the fund. Considering the importance of GRF in providing cushion to the states\u2019 fiscal health and in order to make the fund attractive for the states, RBI has permitted the member states to avail short-term collateralised funding from RBI at a concessional rate (currently at 200 bps below the prevailing Repo Rate) under the Special Drawing Facility (SDF) against their investment in the Fund. This helps the states in bringing down their overall cost of borrowing. RBI has also set up a separate Working Group on CSF/GRF to look into the operational challenges faced by the states in becoming member of the GRF and in making contributions to the fund.

    "output": "Guarantees or contingent liabilities are potential liabilities that depend on the occurring of an unforeseen future event. If these liabilities are realised without having adequate buffer, it may imply increase in expenditure, deficit and debt levels for the State Government. It is, therefore, important to assess, monitor and be prudent while issuing guarantees. Besides, State Governments need to be consistent and transparent in terms of disclosure of information on guarantees. In pursuance of the guidelines suggested by the various Committees set up under the aegis of RBI and the State Finance Secretaries (SFS) Conference, most of the states have adopted risk mitigation measures which, inter alia, include fixing ceiling on guarantees, setting up of reserve funds, i.e., CSF/ GRF, levying guarantee fee, publishing information relating to total outstanding guarantee, risk categorization of the guarantees, etc. It is however observed that all the states have not implemented these measures. Also, there is lack of uniformity amongst states while putting in place these measures. There should not be any distinction made between Conditional/ Unconditional, Financial/ Performance guarantees as far as assessment of fiscal risk is concerned as all of these are in the nature of contingent liability that might get crystallized on a future date. The word \u2018Guarantee\u2019 should be used in a broader sense and may include instruments, by whatever name they are called, if these create obligation on the part of the Guarantor (State) for making payment on behalf of the borrower (State Enterprise) at a future date, contingent or otherwise."

    "output": "States should continue with their contributions towards building up the GRF to a desirable level of five per cent of their total outstanding guarantees over a period of five years from the date of constitution of the fund, maintaining the corpus on a rolling basis thereafter. State Governments may insist on the state undertakings, whose borrowings are guaranteed to set up an arrangement for provisions for meeting possible shortfalls in project earnings, including setting up escrow accounts with predetermined and regular contributions from project earnings. To develop a proper database for capturing all guarantees, a unit responsible for tracking all guarantees may be designated at the state level, preferably within the Department of Finance, to act as a Monitoring Unit (MU) responsible for compilation, consolidation, maintenance of the database, and continuous monitoring. State Governments may publish/disclose data relating to guarantees, as per the IGAS (Annex I) recommended by Government of India (GoI, 2010), which can also be used by CAG for their audit and by RBI for its annual publication \u2018State Finances: A Study of Budgets\u2019. RBI may consider advising banks/NBFCs to disclose credit extended to state-owned entities backed by State Government guarantees to improve the credibility of the reported/published data."

    "output": "Delay in honouring guaranteed obligations may affect the sanctity of guarantees issued, potentially resulting in reputational and legal risks for the state government. Banks and financial institutions may become wary of extending fresh finance to any state enterprise if the state has failed in honouring its guarantee commitments. Additionally, fresh guarantees issued by the state government may not be readily accepted by lenders/investors.

    "output": "The Technical Committee on State Government Guarantees (1999) made the following recommendations:\n\nCeiling on guarantees: To ensure fiscal sustainability and discrimination in giving guarantees, State Governments should fix a ceiling on guarantees. This ceiling should be legislated, as enabled in the Constitution of India.\n\nParameters and basis for the ceiling on Guarantees: Four parameters could be used for fixing the ceiling on guarantees:\n\n(a) Link guarantees to a dynamic variable such as NSDP. Total outstanding debt plus one-third of outstanding guarantees should not exceed 50 percent of the NSDP. A modification is suggested for States using guarantees to raise resources for infrastructure since 1994-95, giving equal weight to guarantees and debt.\n\n(b) Link guarantees to revenue receipts. Each State Government could work out the flexible cash available after deducting obligatory expenditure from Central tax devolution, States own tax revenues, and non-tax revenues. Outflows on account of guarantees could be related to the coverage available against the flexible cash flow, maintaining a coverage of 10:1 over the period of the loans/guarantee. The net present value concept could be incorporated.\n\n(c) Link guarantees and debt to the consolidated fund itself. Guarantees plus debt together should not exceed twice the receipts in the consolidated fund.\n\n(d) Ensure that the ratio of incremental guarantees to incremental net market borrowings is kept constant or brought down.\n\nEach State Government should have the flexibility to choose the most appropriate parameter while ensuring transparency in respect of all parameters. While each state may legislate on the ceiling on guarantees, it should have the freedom to choose any of the parameters listed above to serve as the basis for fixing the ceiling. Simultaneously, there is advantage in reporting to the legislature the extant position in terms of each of the four parameters."

    "input": "Question: What are some ways to ensure more selectivity in calling for and providing guarantees, according to the Technical Committee on State Government Guarantees (1999)?",
    "output": "The proposal for prescribing a ceiling on guarantees is practical only if there is more selectivity in the calling for of and in the providing of guarantees. Such selectivity can be practised in the following ways:\n(a) Each State may lay down the procedures to be followed in case of projects or units where State guarantee is involved, identifying a nodal officer in the Finance department, who could co-ordinate the proposals involving guarantees. It will also be in the interest of banks and financial institutions to involve the Finance Departments in any financial arrangement involving the provision of guarantee by State Governments.\n(b) Some degree of risk sharing between the lenders/investors, borrowers and State Government is desirable in the interest of ensuring efficient utilisation of funds and financial discipline. Instead of State Governments providing guarantee for 100 per cent of the loan/bond, guarantee could be restricted to 75 per cent to start with and adjusted suitably depending upon the project with the concurrence of the investor/lender.\n(c) States may give immediate attention to finalisation of the audited accounts of State public sector enterprises in order to minimise the cases where guarantees are required.\n(d) Where State level housing and urban development agencies do not have clear title for the immovable properties owned /held by them, the States could explore the possibility of creating a deed of transfer similar to that executed by the Government of Tamil Nadu, to obviate the need for guarantees especially in favour of HUDCO and LIC for housing loans and for loans to develop urban property especially for commercial purposes.\n(e) In the interest of ensuring better selectivity in the matter of giving guarantees, NABARD, the finance and the co- operation department of the State Government should together formulate a plan based on historical default at various levels, to minimise the need for provision of guarantees. The possibility of introducing a system of \u2018risk sharing\u2019 between the State Government, NABARD and the co-operatives bank could also be considered.\n(f) Amendment to the NCDC Act, removing the mandatory requirement of guarantee, may be expedited. In sanctioning loans, NCDC could be governed more by the viability of the project assisted and the financial position of the co -operative assisted so that the need for guarantee is automatically obviated. As in the case of NABARD, introduction of a system of risk sharing could be thought of.\n(g) The reasons for asking for guarantee could be given in writing by the banks and financial institutions to the Finance Secretary, who could either justify the intrinsic viability or take steps to improve the viability.\n(h) Even for non- commercial projects requiring guarantees, States will need to evolve arrangements for increasing the stake in such projects by each of the stake holders viz., the beneficiaries, the Government and the financial institutions.\n(i) In case of infrastructure projects there could be greater selectivity in the matter of calling for and providing of guarantees. Where guarantees are given for infrastructure projects, there should be some accountability for implementation and milestones could be drawn up for monitoring. The availability of guarantee must not lead to a feeling that the bonds/ borrowings backed by such guarantee do not have to be serviced by the project itself.\n(j) At present, once guarantees are given, there is no review as to whether they need to be continued if the project has attained viability. States could consider phasing out of"

    "output": "As projects achieve viability, guarantees could be phased out in concurrence with financing agencies, rating agencies, or trustees on behalf of bond holders. Milestones could be specified and monitored for each project to facilitate this. Regarding the honoring of guarantees, it is in the interest of State Governments to ensure that all guarantees in respect of loans and bonds are immediately honored whenever there is default. The manner in which the States handle the issue of default in honoring of guarantees will play a very important role in ensuring the success of their market borrowing programme. If necessary, RBI could be authorized to earmark a portion of new loans towards arrears in payment, or special bonds could be issued to banks and financial institutions in lieu of accumulated arrears. These measures should be viewed as exceptional and one-time to avoid moral hazard."

    "output": "State governments should encourage the State Electricity Boards to build up a risk fund to handle the contingent liability on account of exchange risk under escrow account arrangements provided to IPPs. Along with disclosure of guarantees, States should also disclose the revalued liabilities of the State Electricity Boards under IPPs or similar arrangements for other utilities.\nStandardisation of guarantee documents though desirable would be difficult. Each State government could however evolve its own standard documentation for guarantees.\nNormally, the guarantee fee should be so structured that the receipts from such fees will take care of the devolvement. Guarantee fees should be invariably charged, appropriately calculated and properly accounted for. The charging of guarantee fee should be rationalised and each State should set up a contingency fund or make some provision for discharging the devolvement under guarantees. The fees collected should be credited to the fund set up for the purpose.\nAs part of exercises leading to budget, the Committee recommends that guarantees given by State governments may be made a regular item of discussion during the annual plan discussion, specifically at the stage of resource mobilisation exercise.\nIn line with the trend towards consolidated presentation of accounts, the Committee recommends that a summary of the financial statements of 100 per cent State-owned corporations may form part of the notes relating to budgets of the State governments."

    "output": "In 2002, the Group to Assess the Fiscal Risk of State Government Guarantees noted the developments in the management of guarantees by states, finding that seven states (Assam, Goa, Gujarat, Karnataka, Rajasthan, Sikkim, West Bengal) had either administrative or statutory limits on guarantees, with Kerala and Tamil Nadu in the process of fixing a ceiling. Regarding transparency, the Group recommended that states publish data regarding guarantees regularly, in the format recommended by the Group of Finance Secretaries in the annual budget, and disclose both the annual sanctions of guarantees and outstanding amounts in the state budget. They also suggested designating a Tracking Unit for guarantees at the state level in the Ministry of Finance to create a proper database, and disclosing information on default, invocation, and payment performance. The Group observed a rising trend of outstanding guarantees, growing at an average rate of about 16% per annum between 1992 and 2001, with the power sector constituting 44.6% of these guarantees. Banks (15%) and all-India financial institutions (25%) were significant investor classes. The Group recommended that the need for guarantees in favor of central financing agencies owned by the Government should be examined and potentially eliminated, emphasizing due diligence and commercial viability assessment by lending institutions. For assessing fiscal risk, the Group concluded that classifying guarantees by default probabilities would not accurately reflect the fiscal risk in the Indian context. Instead, they suggested segregating guarantees that are effectively direct liabilities, reporting them separately, and assessing their risk at 100%, clubbing them with debt for assessing the state's debt profile. They recommended that repayment provisions for such guarantees should be included in the budget itself."

    "output": "According to the Group to Assess the Fiscal Risk of State Government Guarantees (2002), the following methodology was suggested for assessing fiscal risk of guarantee obligations:\n\na. Guarantees that are effectively direct liabilities should be segregated, reported separately, and assessed at 100% risk, equivalent to debt. These should be included with debt when evaluating the State's debt profile. The Ministry of Finance, Government of India, will assess this while finalizing the Plan and borrowing program of the State. Repayment provisions for these guarantees should be included in the budget.\n\nb. For other guarantees, fiscal risk measurement is necessary, involving classification of projects/activities as high, medium, low, and very low risk, with assigned risk weights. Risk assessment will be done at the State level, potentially using credit ratings of bonds. While compulsory credit rating is important, the risk should be assessed without the guarantee, possibly with assistance from rating agencies. Dual ratings (with and without guarantee) should be obtained for guaranteed bonds. The rating without guarantee should be used for risk classification. A similar exercise can be undertaken for existing loans and bonds by State Finance Departments.\n\nc. Once guarantees are categorized, state finance departments should use their judgment to assign devolvement probabilities to each risk category (e.g., 5% for very low risk, 25% for low risk, 50% for medium risk, and 75% for high risk). Translation of risk assessment to devolvement probability is a matter of judgment best left to individual States. The devolvement probability is then applied to the underlying guaranteed liabilities to estimate the guarantee devolvement obligation, which is added to the debt service obligation to arrive at the annual fiscal burden of debt and guarantees.\n\nd. Guarantee commissions charged by States may not relate to the underlying risk or be sufficient for the Guarantee Redemption Fund (GRF). Increasing guarantee commission is currently infeasible as most beneficiaries are in the public sector. The Group recommends that at least 1% of outstanding guarantees be transferred annually to the GRF from the fisc to meet the additional fiscal risk arising from guarantees. Collected guarantee commissions could also be credited to this Fund.\n\ne. Increasing existing guarantee commission rates may be impractical as projects may not bear additional guarantees, although merit was seen in linking guarantee fees to risk categories. Each state can decide whether to charge guarantee fees according to risk category.\n\nf. As per the 11th Finance Commission, States should aim to limit interest payments to 18% of revenue receipts in the medium term. This norm could be modified to include guarantee devolvement obligation in addition to interest payments, and the revised norm could be set at 22% of revenue receipts."

The reporting format should be simple, covering State Government guaranteed loans, advances, investments, and inter-temporal movements in defaults. The reporting periodicity should be half-yearly with a one-month lag. The existing data collection practices should continue, with DBS, FID, DNBS, and UBD collecting data from commercial banks, select AIFIs, NBFCs, and UCBs, respectively. The IRDA, NHB, and NABARD should collect and forward data to the RBI for insurance companies, HFCs and HUDCO, and rural co-operative banks, RRBs, NCDC, respectively. The Central Government should collect and forward data for Provident Fund Trusts and the Ministry of Power for PFC, REC, etc. A central 'data warehouse' is needed for all State government guaranteed loans and bonds, and a Core Group should assess the database size, complexity, MIS requirements, and data sharing issues, recommending a suitable IT platform, potentially leveraging the Bank\u2019s Central Database Management System (CDBMS)."

    "output": "The Working Group examined the desirability of disseminating the information related to defaults. While this could be a welcome course from the investor protection angle, legal complexities may come in the way of disseminating the entire spectrum of information on defaults available with the regulators to the public. Since the group did not have the mandate to decide on the legal aspects and decided to leave it to each of the regulators involved to seek legal opinion on the issue.\n\nInstead of publication of data at the issuer level, which in any case is being addressed by the GASAB, the Working Group viewed that (i) individual lender/investor-wise data (broken up into sectors) and (ii) State- wise data on guaranteed advances and investments (including defaults) could be disseminated through the RBI publications (Report on State Finances and Report on Trend and Progress of Banking in India) as at the end of September and the Annual Report as at the end of March). The data on defaults could also be disseminated through the RBI web -site. The implications of this dissemination would be that there would be greater awareness about the likely fiscal risk of providing guarantees and the risk posed by State Government guarantees for financial stability.\n\nIt would be impracticable to capture data on investments by individuals and non- financial corporates (i.e., other than financial institutional investors and lenders), partly because they are too numerous and partly because they have a limited exposure in terms of subscription to guaranteed investments."

The Government of India, RBI, and other institutions could assist States in creating necessary capacity, systems, processes, and acquiring technology for compiling data on liabilities. For compiling data, RBI will provide data on outstanding market borrowings to the State Governments, the Central Government will provide details regarding loans from the Centre and special securities issued by the States to NSSF, and State Governments will provide data on borrowings from banks, financial institutions, and any other such transactions. To ensure data consistency, a single agency should compile and disseminate information on outstanding liabilities, ideally RBI, compiling estimates of liabilities of all States in a single publication. Timely availability of audited data needs to be addressed, and the CAG may compile and publish audited data in addition to the Finance Accounts of the States. Until State Governments can publish the required data in their budget documents, the concerned institutions should furnish the data to the RBI for consolidation and publication as a transitional measure. The RBI should compile the latest available \u2018accounts\u2019 (un-audited) and (revised and budget) estimates of liabilities of all State Governments and publish them in its regular annual publication on State Budgets, and the CAG may provide the latest available audited data for reporting by the RBI in its annual study on State budgets."
